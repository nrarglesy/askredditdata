When I was in my last year of undergraduate I was in a bunch of student clubs and societies. One of them was an atheist/secularist one and a bunch of them would always post about how stupid anyone who believes in God is and how they don't know anything about science.  It was fairly amusing to find one of them in the physics class I was a TA for the next semester. Like bruh shouldn't you be teaching me??

My dad died about 5 years ago. He was a good person, and always tried to see the best in other people. He was sick for a long time, and so it wasn‚Äôt unexpected, but still very sad.  I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it: if you have a good relationship with anyone, and they die, it‚Äôs going to suck. Hard. You are going to feel like the colour has left the world, that laughing is disrespectful to their memory, and you‚Äôre going to have the thought of ‚Äúoh, I should ask them about... no... wait.... they‚Äôre dead‚Äù and it‚Äôll hurt all over again. Rinse, wash, repeat. Over and over and over.  While you are going through this, you need to make a conscious effort to make sure that you‚Äôre doing all the things that you need to do to keep alive. Eating actual vegetables, getting exercise, washing yourself, changing your clothes, getting sunshine.  And it will suck, but as trite as it is, it gets better. Someone makes a stupid joke, and you laugh. The hole they left will fill with the memories you had. The colour will eventually come back in, little by little.  Hope you‚Äôre okay there OP.
I‚Äôm blue da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die.

Yes and no.  I got an account and some insurance with the same bank. I forgot about it for some time. I had a debt but they couldn't reach me for so long (I moved olaces in between), they closed the account and have written it off.
The shit hole next to WONDERFUL GARY INDIANA!   Home of Michael Jackson and the famous Gary Steelworks, giving America her muscle in fighting the war on COMMUNISEXUALTHIESMLAM.   A new disease... Why pick up a steel rail beam at the gift shop and whack degenerates, just like dad!

I didn't say I need a good smartphone, I said cheaper ones break faster. I get cheap ones and they all brick themselves within 2-3 years maximum from one day to the next with no apparent reason or warning. Once this happens, they are completely unusable. The one I'm writing on is only a couple of years old and spends more time crashing than anything else, but I'm not going spend my whole month's water, electricity, and food money on a new phone, I'll wait till this one bricks, then get another cheap one because I have responsibilities.
You've hit the nail on the head right there.  Most first-time watchers watch it with huge expectations of it living up to the first one.  But if you watch it with managed expectations, it's not bad at all.  Loved every scene with Dr. Oken in it!
Alex Trebek. Me and my dad used to watch jeopardy together every day, and it was really the only time we got to bond.

If home is where the heart is then maybe they are heartless people?
You do realize the difference is trivial right? The only difference between crocodiles and what you‚Äôre considering ‚Äúdinosaurs‚Äù is that crocodiles have legs that extend from the sides whereas dinosaurs extend from underneath? Aside from that, they share the same common ancestor, lived alongside each other in the same time period, and ate the same things. One might even say they are the same and the fact that crocodiles legs evolved slightly differently from all other dinosaurs is a trivial difference that doesn‚Äôt really matter unless you‚Äôre being really, really picky about it.

Please, this is not a docudrama, this is obviously a fetish pseudosnuff movie in a docudrama wrapping. It was clearly made for the sake of cruelty, not for the sake of memory of the poor people who were tortured there.
Aaron Burr, but the opposite.  LMM made it so he was relatably careful and anxious but the man was just a genuine asshole and a downright traitor. He had a second, secret family, never a day in his life regretted murdering Hamilton and spent years directly after the fact planning a (and I kid you not) a whole coup for him to claim a chunk of America as his own- to one day perhaps conquer America to make it a monarchy of his name. Fuck Aaron Burr
Gift my closest people enough money to love comfortably and then stop worrying about everything.
I believe in initial connection at first sight. But that is not what I would class as love- I see love as a much more intimate terms that is much deeper that what these people experience at first sight.   And yes, I believe that these can form a long lasting relationship if grown into love. That initial feeling is not ‚Äòlove‚Äô- like I‚Äôm saying I wouldn‚Äôt believe someone if they say they talked to someone for 5 mins then said they are madly in love with them.   Strong connection that can turn into love, yes. Literal, ‚Äòlove‚Äô at first sight, no.
A letter my grandpa wrote me about how heartbroken he was to know my grandma was in heaven and he had to live without her.   I didn‚Äôt lose the letter, it was stolen from me from an ex in an attempt to hurt me. It worked and I haven‚Äôt seen it since.
David Bowie really hurt. We had just been to an amazing exhibition of his work in Melbourne and had seen Labyrinth in the cinema, a couple months later he was gone. So sad.

You remind me of that song from Offspring, The kids aren't all right.
You wouldn't like working where I do then. Garlic, tobacco, alcohol... Something that I can't identify, but definitely has all three of those to some degree. These folk got everything.
I like the Fiennes portrayal. I prefer the Noonan one, but maybe that's got something to do with me preferring Manhunter to Red Dragon. When Fiennes is how is chowing down the Red Dragon artwork, that was a bit creepy.
Weirdly enough, John Candy. It was the first celebrity death I could vividly remember. I just remember seeing it on the news and it just clicking that I won‚Äôt see any more of his movies any more.

Comparing the two movies to me is kind of like comparing a ww2 veteran with the columbine school shooters.   They both used guns to kill people.   It's the morality of it which changes everything.
Sounds like life as a millennial, if you replace the nukes with everything but.
fair enough for me, couldn't have said it better myself
The c-PTSD is a tough one. People think PTSD is just for war veterans, but you'd be very surprised how many people suffer from it. It put me in a rehab clinic 6 months later. That helped.         I also have bipolar mood disorder and ADHD  (both pre-existing) which have become more difficult to control because of the traumatic brain injury.         There is no gross functional impairment due to the TBI, but I guess some people would say I've changed. I know I now struggle to read recreationally, where as I used to enjoy a good book every week or two. I just can't seem to keep the plot threads together now like I used to.         I'm on 11 different medications to help control my psychiatric illnesses. I've done meds reviews where I wean off everything to see how I cope without meds, and they end badly, so I am more or less certain that whatever the cause, I am ill and need medicine to assist in keeping me a functional and productive adult. Just like any other chronic illness.         Luckily I have had a very good support structure, a good Psychiatrist and therapist and received the appropriiate treatment.         Most of all, an incredible wife whose patience knows (almost) no bounds and who can handle our twin toddlers like a professional.         All in all: almost deadly motorbike accident - 100% would not recommend.

Made my bed. It‚Äôs a small step but by actually getting out of the bed, even if you inevitably get back into it, making the bed is the move. Eventually you‚Äôll just be like well I don‚Äôt want to make it again and now that I‚Äôm up maybe I‚Äôll do ‚Ä¶anything.

When people get pregnant and you don't immediately laugh cause you are not sure if it was  accidental or not. When I was young the pregnancy wasn't planned but it is actually likely to be pregnant my age.  I'm in my mid twenties and some of my friends are getting married. Scary s**t...

Happened many a time and I‚Äôve been on both sides of that. After one date you forget it pretty quickly. The objective of a date obviously is to establish if there‚Äôs enough compatibility/energy/desire to move forward. If the other person thinks there isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶cool, was one date, I‚Äôm not overly invested. Immediately disappointed but we move forward and not dwell on it
You can pull off a lot of shit if you just mutter to yourself "20 seconds of courage" when an obstacle comes up. And then cowboy up for 20 seconds. After that, I usually see that the obstacle wasn't as bad as I previously though. Knock that pussy of the pedestal.

My roommate and I became very close friends in our freshman year. Now, two years later, she got an internship (in her defense it was a really demanding IB internship) and i wouldn't hear from her in weeks. When I stopped reaching out to her our communication died. But later, when she got free and done with her internship she would only reach out in group chats asking if anyone wants to go out.  It sounds very trivial as I'm writing it, but personally I have decided to not engage in relationships with people that don't seem to have the time for me or don't put in the effort. There are no hard feelings because as you grow older your priorities change and you have less time.

I wouldn't say it's rich thing, more of middle class youth thing.  But what I hate is the lack of clothes that are whole under the "latest fashion" section.  They say they're selling new clothes, but all of those have fake holes in them. To me it's a waste of manufacturing costs.
Additionally talking about your mental health isn‚Äôt nearly as stigmatising for women as it was for men until recent years. So women are probably more likely to get help from friends or medical professionals for their depression, discuss their desire to end their life and have people intervene.   Even now there‚Äôs a long way to go until men feel safe sharing their feelings and emotions openly. It‚Äôs been generations of telling men to ‚Äúman up‚Äù that it will take generations to undo the damage.

At 1b, giving 10m is like having 100$ and giving $1 to family, and the 1m to friends is 0.10$. It's nothing really.

Immediately dump it into a fund with a low % interest and guarantees.  If/when the mistake is found and they contact me to get the money back, I will happily return the money and keep the thousands or millions of interest.

Heartbroken
When I realized I'm as old as my father was when my parents had me... I'm the third of three, and they got a late start in having kids... and I haven't even really started living.  Really strikes deep.  One of my cousin's said christimas before the apocalypse... "you know you three boys are the last of the 'our family name'  if you don't have children the 'family name' dies with our generation.  I never thought I was going to have a 'biological clock' but I feel that - I think that is a big sign of my age.
 i‚Äôm not sure if this counts at a movie, but the trials of gabriel fernandez absolutely broke me. the graphic depiction of the abuse and horror that child went through and the blatant negligence by the CPS people in LA country during that time made me spiral for a few days. i cried so much and felt so powerless.   i don‚Äôt mean to get political, but as someone who is generally against the death penalty, i‚Äôm glad that his stepfather who ultimately killed him, was sentenced to death. the mom deserved it more, frankly, but she got off with a life sentence since she plead guilty. that made me furious too.

Talking about how much you love books and reading.  Had a friend of friend like this with a huge collection of books, everytime we were at her house she'd go on about how intellectually superior she was to others because of it.  No one had the heart to tell her Terry Pratchrt and Harry Potter are largely aimed at children and books on subjects like Crystal Healing, Wicca, Tarot etc scream the opposite of clever.
Well that‚Äôs fun. Happy cake day!
Wondering where it came from. Then get it all in hard cold cash, so my parents wont figure it out and confiscate it. Then, go to the store, and get that epic gaming setup that i always wanted. Then save the rest for later, so i dont have to get a loan for my studies etc.

I used to hate music untill a couple months ago.

Thank you for getting to these topics: Odors--your fabric softener, your body odor, your fast food or residual from the awful restaurant you went to for lunch-- heat, fabrics--any wool, cashmere, acrylics and other artificial fibers, sounds--including certain voices--and your eating, smacking, sucking on candy and chewing gum, sighing...The perception is extraordinarily helpful in certain careers, because we "just know." It helps to avoid danger. And there is no place for BS. But it's also draining, because we pick up on so much, it's like being a sponge.

At that time he worked for customs, tracking down the backgrounds to determine who had clearance. He saw a lot of shit, and after receiving an award in the White House, he quit right after that- and was stationed into another position.  I was always confused because my mom/step dad would talk about the subject openly, but my dad refuses because he has the images in his head.

Kobe Bryant‚Äôs death hit me the hardest because of how tragic it was. Many basketball fans knew that he always went everywhere with his helicopter, but who would ever expect that he would die from one. It was also the day after LeBron passed him on the all-time scoring list and they were both being talked about on ESPN.   The fact that his daughter died as well was just so heartbreaking and it still feels unreal to this day. Both she and Kobe had so much ahead of them you‚Äôd never think they would in a million years be dead.    Man, I still can‚Äôt believe it‚Ä¶ RIP Mamba, thanks for always inspiring me.

Don't know what to say about that. Is ,,good for you" sound offensive?
Anyone with Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller?
You my friend, have the easiest issue to solve.  Students are expected to learn and explore. Take it from a long-time academic turned professional (with an interdisciplinary career between several 'most challenging fields').  The question is, "Are you being productive?"  If you spend a couple months learning additional biochemical kinetics, it's directed study. If you write, you're practicing your trade. Trying to do a little programming to see if it's right for you? Great. Helping out at a non-profit, food-bank, or literally any other place can be a great way to see how different economic sectors work. Nearly anything you do while in college can be framed successfully. Even starting music lessons can be rationalized, and could help jumpstart a healthy work/life balance for your career. (If you took a full load and a half of classes, would the question of not working even be an issue?)  Here's the caveat... Beer pong and TV do not count. You actually have to be productive in one way or another. Just be honest about it.

I feel this, I have feelings for one of my best friends and of course he has a girlfriend and always leads me on and says he loves me blah blah blah , and of course I love him back but its been 3 years of leading me on so I friend zoned him and he got sad and pissed off , and he's my only friend, I dont want to lose him, but being friends is the only way we can be in each other's lives because I know he's going to hurt me lol I know you didn't ask but damn it felt good to let out
Psst, I dig the username~

I hear Pacific Rim‚Äôs sequel was dogshit. I‚Äôm not gonna taint my positive view of the first movie just to confirm this claim.
Antichrist really made an impact on me
Martyrs. F that  movie
All I know is it was alcohol intoxication. From what I remember, it wasn't determined to be suicide. Is there more to it? Did I hear wrong?
Amen
Thank that cool Nigerian Prince
Martyrs tops it for me. Being french I'm also very proud of what they were able to achieve. That's the only movie that made me look away during some scene.
Lmao I wasn't aware that the first date should allow whatever groping the other person pleases

I dont rememeber the name. But   There was this horror movie i wasnt allowed to watch but i had to go into the room with the big kids to ask my aunt a question ( mostlikly about food) and saw a dude fighting off people with blood coming from their eyes and had wierd tentacles coming from their belly buttons. I had night mares for days months and i think it was a james gunn movie. I dont know but it fucked me up.

I agree that "a few weeks" after a 2 year relationship seems extremely premature
From a medical standpoint, there are rare conditions where a person cannot consume meat based proteins/protein, so... health wise I guess its one of those things if you must, you must.  Other than that... I guess its one of those; as long as it doesn't impact the childs growth & development, parents should do whatever they feel is best for THEIR child \[in my opinion\].
Hierarchy-wise it still fits better.  Tolkien, for all his virtues was still a human raised as a christian. And Eru singing creation into existance sounds a whole lot more like "let there be light"  than slaying Ymir and making Midgard from his corpse or a seafoam horse and men made from treebark.  Sounds like Tolkien could have used a bit more selfawareness about his personal biases.

What is the guy holding on the cover according to you? I always thought it was a flag.

Jerry Orbach.   He played Detective Lenny Brisco in the original Law and Order. I was sitting in the OBGYN office, pregnant with my second child and it just gutted me when I heard he had passed. I had seen every episode of the original. I‚Äôm sure hormones had nothing to do with my breaking down lol.    Robin Williams was a very close second. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch What Dreams May Come. It hits in an entirely different way now.
Small talk makes me happy sometimes, like just to be acknowledged and chatted with occasionally. Like there was a guy who had a conversation with me in the waiting room at the doctor, he asked me if taking vitamins could help my narcolepsy hahaha. I‚Äôm gonna remember that for the next week now because he was nice and I thought that what he said was so silly.   Another thing would be someone just genuinely listening to me. I feel like I get ignored a lot, or not taken seriously. It‚Äôd be nice if someone could just tolerate my word vomit for 5-10 minutes and not seem super annoyed or bored or something.

Yes.   I always thought I fell in love a lot. I did it over and over again. I actually thought love wasn't "chemistry" and "fireworks", it was just companionship and strong friendship. All that "magic" claptrap was from Hollywood and Disney. I got married, I got divorced. Married again, divorced again. Still hopeful though, because I fell in love easily.  Then I met him. I fiiiinally understood what I had been missing. It all finally made sense. Nothing in my life was ever like this before. Yes, there is companionship - the most satisfying sort of comfortable togetherness. Yes, there is friendship - the best and strongest of my life. But it is so much more. Soooo much more. He is everything to me, and I am to him too. 6 years into the (I now know) only love of my life, we got married. And still, six years in, I smile just to look at him. I smile going to sleep every night with him beside me. I smile waking up every morning because he's there. Magic is right, fireworks are right. It's all there. We can't get enough of each other, and we never get sick of hanging out together. He is my best friend and the best person I have ever known.  Nothing has ever felt like this before. Even if it feels like love, even if it hurts - true love is a million times better, and a million times more worth it.   Yes.
The same.

i think reddit is one of the worst things that has happened to the internet due to the upvote and downvote system. people generally dont want a real discussion, they want to interject with a snappy zinger to get some sweet sweet dopamine from upvotes. I often see initial interactions that appear quite hostile before giving way to civility deeper in the thread. often, as i am sure you have seen the civility never comes. i have been using the internet for over 20 years and i remember when reddit first started and was irrelevant and quickly became the one stop for all things internet for a new breed of internet user: the redditor. characterized by a love of easily digestible pop-science over more rigorous investigation or discussion, reddit is widely maligned by the wider net  for its errant groupthink, its relentless persecution and suppression of internal discussion, and leading proponent of the sterilizing trends in web design which seem bent on stripping all soul and color from the internet and replacing it with rigidly enforced political orthodoxy.

Yeah I've heard  about this on some threads as well, still haven't understood it fully but something like taking loans for very low interest and putting their assets as collateral they can escape inheritance tax and spend money. I feel its all sounds complicated, yes I get it their accounts do this, but I still feel its like thin ice they are walking on, and a slight bump in their process from external or internal forces can cause everything to come crashing down, getting them in deep trouble. I feel if u got that much money, just use it straight up, or invest it some super safe but low return stuff, and just live off that, but I guess we humans are greedy and like it says somewhere in my religion, if Allah(God) gave a human a mountain of gold, he would ask for a second one.

Serbian film  An ageing porn star agrees to participate in an art film in order to make a clean break from the business, only to discover that he has been drafted into making a paedophilia and necrophilia themed snuff film.  Many horror films take acts of intimacy and make them horrific; A Serbian Film (2010) does the same, but cranks up the violence and intensity to a nauseating degree, making it a frontrunner for the most disturbing movie ever made

Probably between 5-8 maybe? Sometimes 10 sometimes 1 probably. But if you see a big active community, I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs worth asking questions there. Don‚Äôt expect free lessons but if you have a question, make a post within the guidelines and you‚Äôre likely to get someone chiming in. I use the subreddit plantidentification and it‚Äôs been only incredible for my needs, though perhaps identifying random plants might be a little simpler than excel. Still, why wouldn‚Äôt you get free advice and guidance if you can? I‚Äôm sure some people are gonna be unhelpful from time to time, but it‚Äôs usually a good place to go. A wiki is good to educate yourself without making redundant posts so you can ask questions that are more appealing to the community

Kobe.  Unlike a lot of celebrities who had either drug problems or mental illness, Kobe was the spokesman for will power.  Him being the best he can be is a great aspiration for so many of people, regardless of you were a Kobe fan or not.  I am not saying he is infallible, he certainly made many mistakes, but I am only focusing on the legacy he left behind, the mamba mentality, the will to do everything conceivable to be the best version of you, is certainly all of us can stand behind.  It sounded unreal at the moment because he seemed invincible, bullet proof, almost like a superhero‚Ä¶ so how difficult was it surviving a simple helicopter flight for him‚Ä¶ right?

Amstrad CPC 464 way back in the day. After a while I moved onto Commodore Amiga, realised the supplied Basic interpreter wasn't going to do it. I bought a book at some trade show or computer show about Amiga Assembler. I stuck with it and got a really good understanding of assembler in general. Right at the end of the book it told me to go off and learn C. I went off and ordered a couple of books from the back of CU Amiga and went from there.  This was all before I did my A-Level Computing. Back then, the A-Level was primitive and I was surprised when my first homework assignments were handed back with D's and E's (quite low grades). I was annoyed as I knew perfectly well what a stack was, what a queue was and what an accumulator was, what the program counter did, yada yada.  Eventually I figured out that what the teacher wanted was that when a homework question was given, we essentially re-write what was in the book just using a different form of words regardless of whether or not it was applicable in all situations or not. Like I say, the A-Level in Computing was pretty ill thought out and seemed to be based on one single book. Any deviation from the rubric whatsoever would cost you grades even if you were correct and it addressed the question. Stupid really. It was literally take a sentence, rewrite it in different words, there is the answer.  There were a couple of pseudo-code based questions but the question did say "in any language". I remember I handed in one answer based entirely on Amiga Assembler. He graded it F as he claimed it was not a real language. I did plead with my parents to let me bring in my Amiga to show him the full working code but it never happened. My five minutes of glory were not to be. I went back to handing in coding assignments in pseudocode and left it at that, it wasn't worth the headache as there would be no glorious victory.  While I understand that learning parrot-fashion can be effective, the whole exercise made me question continuing it. Thankfully the exam itself wasn't quite as stupid and was not based on one single book.

Thanks, I changed the text and repost. Have a nice day
Twin Peaks is what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äúgenre buster‚Äù: you‚Äôll find horror, comedy / slapstick humor, romance, with a touch of 90s quirkiness that you can‚Äôt find in today‚Äôs shows (times have changed since the first two seasons aired, obviously).  The characters largely contribute to the show. Each and everyone of them has their own personality and ambitions (or lack thereof) and pushes the story forward. Even the small town of Twin Peaks feels alive.  Another major point to consider is that back in the day when it aired for the first time, Twin Peaks was a novelty. The show was the first (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) to offer a main plot that spread across entire seasons, whereas previous TV shows used to wrap up their intrigues by the end of this week‚Äôs episode.  Lastly, there‚Äôs this campy feel when you watch an episode after getting back from work. Once you hear the opening theme, you know you‚Äôre out of our reality and into another where dreams and nightmares coexist and share cherry pie and black-as-a-moonless-night coffee.

Working in a hotel bar for a luxury hotel. Had a guy come in around 3 in the morning. Really nothing was happening anymore since it was the middle of the week. He sat down opposite of me and ordered 2 bottles of champagne (for the last 2 guests that were still around) order two cocktails for my colleague and I and afterwards our most expensive Whiskey (Johnnie Walkers King George) which we sell at a solid 75‚Ç¨ per 4cl.... he proceeded to drink half of the bottle being around 40 cl (so 750 bucks only for the whiskey). Later he ended up telling us his wife cheated on him with his best friend, took the kids to leave for her mothers house and he had no other real friends to turn to since all he did was work.  Holy shit I felt awful listening to the guy as you could tell that his life was 100% ruined He ended up spending around 1200 bucks on drinks and a little to eat and gave a 200‚Ç¨ tip when he was about to leave thanking us for listening...  I really hope he's doing better and atleast got his kids or something. Seemed like a nice guy...  Maybe not the most fucked up story but it stuck with me cause you could feel the guys pain. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

I think women should be allowed an abortion if they choose to have an abortion.  Before I continue, I want to point out that I understand I havent got my head wrapped around this issue, and I hope that someone will educate me/give me some perspective.  One moral dilemma regarding 100% commitment to the will of the mother is; what if the father didn't want a child (for example, failure of contraceptive device)?  And what if, then, the mother decides to have the baby anyway? It seems cruel and evil for a would-be father to be denied the right to an abortion, in the same way that denying women abortions does.

Chadwick Boseman. I had literally *just* finished watching Da 5 Bloods and the credits were rolling when I decided to go through the notifications my phone had accumulated throughout the movie. I got to Twitter and saw the tweet from his official account announcing that he had passed. It hit me hard, not only because of the role he had played in the movie I had just watched, or because he was so young, but also because he just made the world brighter with everything he did. And afterwards, finding out that he was in so much pain while still doing what he loved and making other people happy, it made me respect him even more.

Sure, when I was younger I used to have a nightmare where me, my sister & my mum just left a rollercoaster park.. As we exit I see a zombie looking thing circle around our car, my mum says to me, "Don't be scared, as long as you dont make a sound or go too close it wont hurt us", like it is a completely standard thing. As I approach the car extremely scared as soon as I got around 30ft away from it.. I wake up in fear. This exact dream happened countless times and lasted a very short amount of time... I recently found out through my therapist that this was due to untreated/unacknowledged trauma. Its crazy looking back at how much this nightmare made sense.

I think the concept does exist, but it's a pretty fine line. The example I like to use is a Chinese restaurant that was being opened in I believe NYC that its white owners were marketing as "clean" and "healthy" compared to usual Chinese food. The way it was phrased definitely felt very patronizing, and they were also perpetuating false stereotypes around MSG. They were trying to benefit from Chinese culture while simultaneously putting it down. A more recent example would be a group who tried to redesign mahjong tiles while putting down the original, traditional designs. In both cases, the issue is not someone of another culture taking part in different cultural traditions, but that they were trying to profit from it while also insulting the original culture.

Always been a little fluffier, despite being an active kid/teenager, due to growing up with not so great eating habits.   Followed that up with ME/CFS since age 16 and the chubbiness that came with such reduced activity. Though that did force me to become a lot stricter with what I eat, and I stayed "just" chubby for most of my 20s.  Then in my late 20s, pregnancy weight gain and a hypothyroidism diagnosis shortly after, and I'm pretty firmly in the fat category now.   So a mix of factors, both controllable and uncontrollable I guess. It's been a hard thing to accept, but over time I have, and it just is what it is now.
Yeah.
Fair enough, for me though Steins Gate and Katawa Shoujo are the only VNs I properly played through.      As the anime isn't exactly an action fest, it works really well as a VN. It's fully voiced excluding Okabe's internal thoughts.     In regards to 0, there is a separate VN for that with a bunch of paths, I haven't played it though. Liked the anime for it so maybe I should give it a go.
It does but after a while, I mean you won't feel anything the moment you're shot
In West Philidelphia born and raised....
I did them in the summers when I was in elementary school (in the 90s) it was a lot of going with your regular friends because your parents and your friends parents would agree to send the kids to wherever. A lot of staying up late in the bunks/cabins whatever sleep arrangements. Each day you‚Äôd have some outdoors activities and games which were either super fun or lame, no in between. The food mostly sucked and you‚Äôd be too tired by the early evening of some days to even want dinner yet be up giggling with friends after lights out. You‚Äôd usually hit a wall in which you‚Äôd do anything to go home and then wish to never leave when the parents came to finally bring you home.
To a greater extent than other first meetings that do not experience it. Yes I understand that they may feel emotions of love more than those who do not experience the phenomenon. Doesn‚Äôt mean I believe they are in love.

Lol, I was so disappointed when I bought the first Telltale Walking Dead game. Thought I'd be running around killing zombies and being badass.  Ended up loving it though.
In Ireland the government pays all prescription drug costs over ‚Ç¨140 per month, no matter what your income is. About 50% of the population pay nothing. CPAP rental also included. The UK government pays for all drugs.

Reddit is great for getting *ideas* but not necessarily reliabile information - there are definitely plenty of smart people who post reliable content but there's no way to vet that against less smart people BS'ing on knowledge-vapour. If you ask a question and someone proposes an answer you hadn't considered, either test or confirm that solution yourself
Oooh, that books getting ordered by me today - sounds great!  Yes, that was my biggest gripe with Resurgence.  We fell in love with the characters in ID4, we got their stories and relationships and we invested in them and that was a HUGE part of how the movie makes you feel.    I felt the characters were very lazily portrayed in Resurgence and I definitely didn't feel a bond to any of them except - of course - those who had also been in ID4.  LOVED Dr. Oken!

Scar on my back. Friends and I decided to take a strip of acid and go skateboarding. Well one thing led to another and I tried ollying off of a roof onto a trampoline.

I think here it‚Äôs part of a flow chart script of some type that‚Äôs designed to keep the caller calm and give the patient the best chance of survival if they aren‚Äôt breathing. Think of it more suitable to heart attacks and things like that, which guided CPR could have a life saving effect. The lady answering the call at the ambulance call centre did not know how horrific the event was when she began that call so dutifully followed procedure until I told her.  I could have been more clear on the phone yet my brain mentally shit itself in the moments afterwards. I was in shock. It hasn‚Äôt affected me a great deal since it happened (about 6 years ago), although sometimes I have the odd nightmare about it. I have no connection to the man, I don‚Äôt know his name, i don‚Äôt know what he looked like, I was spared the necessity to attend the coroners inquest. I‚Äôd like to keep that element of anonymity so to severe any emotional ties to the incident. To me he is some poor bloke who died and it‚Äôs not my problem to grieve over it.  I know it‚Äôs a harsh way of looking at it, but it works for me.

Ah don't worry about it. I'm not saying it's minor, just that audiences are probably more likely to see the others first.  The double seater cockpit is an excellent example of the many, many times the crew apparently decided to bend reality to fit their asinine plot and didn't second guess themselves.
Ah I guess that's a question of 'Are nomads homeless?'  But I think OP just meant regular homeless people we see on the street, but their premise of home=social construct was a bit iffy

I don‚Äôt know which celebrity death has hit me the hardest, but Prince is the only one with which my reaction was disbelief. I was genuinely hoping to find out that it was a hoax, or that he was reported dead but it turns out he was hospitalized but going to be okay, or something along those lines. I remember thinking ‚ÄúNo, that can‚Äôt be right. Not Prince.‚Äù He was truly so larger than life that his death was something that my brain couldn‚Äôt make sense of.

It was at the height of the hollywood shutdown and I guess for a period after and it's because at the time Australia was completely open and mostly COVID free. One of the biggest one's is Chris Hemsworth moving to Byron Bay, and I believe Thor: Love and Thunder was mostly filmed in Australia. I could be wrong about specifics but there has been a few big films released in the last year that were filmed here. Now that other countries are more vaccinated than we are though I've heard of one movie that moved from Australia to Europe but I can't think of the name right now.  Yet another example of our government squandering our COVID advantage.

It hit 108 degrees Fahrenheit this summer here in Seattle, 115 in surrounding areas.  Normally we might get a week or two in the 90s, and almost nobody here has air conditioning in their homes.  It's been getting worse and worse every year.  Climate change is real, folks.
Sorry but this is just bullshit. Why would you apologise for something your grand grandparents have done? People you probably never met in your life and know nothing about. And why do you call other nations racist when you yourself are just as racist?
Ugh, this was a legit fear of mine, and still in many ways is. I used to do research on types of radiation and how likely it was to survive. I still to this day have a dream of owning my own bomb shelter, keeping it stocked with food and running nicely. I know it‚Äôs not a very realistic goal to have, but I‚Äôm childfree, I will never have kids, and I believe in taking care of my self, even if it‚Äôs giving my self a few more months or years in the face of a global catastrophe. I view wanting one as another viable option for global pandemics as well as impact events that threaten life on earth. It‚Äôs just something that would make me very content to know I addressed as well as I am personally able to do so. If that makes sense!

Provided the money is mine I would buy a house with lots of land, build paddocks and rescue some donkeys. Then I'd rescue a load of cats and dogs, employ some staff to help me care for them and the house, support some local charities by giving them large sums and then just live my life with the animals. I'd also buy a lot of smaller properties, convert some of them to disabled friendly and then rent at a low cost to disabled people or people with pets who are struggling to find rentals that accept pets. I'd also buy properties for my friends to live in free of charge and offer them well paying jobs working with my animals if they wished or help them go back to uni to learn a new career that they would enjoy. After doing all that I would probably just live off the interest and as I don't plan to have kids I'd leave the bulk to charity.

There's this interview of Chris talking about Kurt Cobain's suicide saying how he doesn't understand suicide because you can heal pain with some time. Man..     Edit: (Found the interview)   *‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt that close,‚Äù Cornell answered, when Stern questioned him about whether or not Cobain‚Äôs death impacted him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd had friends die before that. The way that he did it was kind of a twist, but other than that, I‚Äôd been through it before. But it‚Äôs a shame, and it‚Äôs a shame for his daughter, for one, and it‚Äôs a shame for fans. But really it‚Äôs a personal thing, and it was a drag. I wish it didn‚Äôt happen. And I also think like if he had just kind of hung on for six months, six months later he could‚Äôve been a completely different guy.‚Äù*

Assuming its really mine;  Get my nan into a top dog care home for alzheimers. Buy her house off her for far more than its worth so we dont lose her house (sentimental to us) and she gets awesome care in a 5 star facility.  Do up her house as I currently live there, with a disabled room downstairs and bathroom so nan can sleep over our house two or three nights a week so that way she's always got a connection to home.  Meanwhile, buy land nearby and start plans to build my dream home.    Gather the 10 most trusted people I know and give them an ultimatum, either they all get a million each in a trust fund they can access for anything they want with the promise they NEVER tell anyone where they got the money and must say they won it on a scratch card or an estranged rich aunt died and left them cash. If anyone refuses, no one gets anything. If I find out they told someone its come from me, they're cut off.   I'd give secret gifts to family and friends, and probably lie after a while and say I won a small amount of money that I have to keep tight if I never want to work again.     Pay off my and my partners student debts.    Become a financial backer for my partners firm,he works in film and they have so many good ideas and work so hard but getting funding to do their jobs and not need part time work is bleh. I could make them their own studios with all the kit and support their first 5 films with % back on the return so that I can keep supporting them.  With a bunch of the rest of money? Donate to charities. At least million to cancer research and alzheimers research.  Maybe set up better more affordable care homes here. Our population is just getting older and they need GOOD care. Not basic care. And affordable care that wont fuck people out of their inheritances :(

That‚Äôs a fair definition.   Human cultures exist where people are nomads without a fixed place to live, cultures exist where accommodation is shared by several groups, cultures exist where people live communally.

That sometimes what you want isn‚Äôt always what you need.   I‚Äôve made a lot of life choices that haven‚Äôt been great because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been selfish, prioritizing what I want and not what I actually need. I often do this with my mental health. I put myself through all of this mess only to be miserable. I want to do exciting things or I want to help out/be around specific people. What I need is stability and to focus on myself so that I can be happy.

Why Don‚Äôt We Do It In The Road
college
At a Rand McNally plant where we printed maps, textbooks. The press room was hot and heavy, 2003 era. On the oldest press in the building, there were no automatic guards. We were "Washing blankets" (holding our hands on industrial powerful cylinders to get ink off). We were supposed to manually put up guards to prevent this. We forgot.  I was in the middle of this process and nearly shit my pants. I just hit the E-stop button. One false move, and I would have been a fuckin sandwich, inside of that press going 100mph.

Costco gasoline stations are the cheapest gas you'll usually find, so they're always packed. These gas stations are usually large and have several lanes and three pumps per lane. It irks me when people take their sweet time when there are so many people are waiting, but that's to be expected. These are, what Bill Burr calls, "in-the-way-people" But what really pisses me off is that one idiot that stops right in the middle of the entrance to the lanes. Let me explain. Costco gasoline stations are usually located adjacent the Costco warehouse in the parking lot. Because there is so much demand, a long line forms snaking though the parking lot just to enter the gasoline station. Because the lanes within the gas station are backed up, the cars entering have to choose which ever lane seems least full as they come in. This means you may end up going to the nearest lane to the entrance or the one farthest. You would think people would be intelligent enough to choose the lane which is least full, but NOOOO. They all bunch up in the lanes nearest the entrance. Yeah, in-the-way-people. So, the entrance is the bottleneck to the whole thing. Here's what pisses me off to no end: There is always an embarrassment to mankind that blocks the very entrance to the gas station itself. The person could've easily been off to the left or right to allow for other cars to get through, or they could have moved inward to one of the lanes farther in, but NOOOO. They choose the obviously crowded lane near the entrance which is so backed up it leaves them blocking entry for everyone else thus stopping all traffic from flowing in until this one lane is able to move forward. In the meantime pumps are freeing up in other lanes but there are no cars to take them. I always feel like getting out of my car, walking over, pulling them out of their car, getting in, and driving it over to a less crowded lane at the farther end. Then hand them their keys with a slap to the face.

Seriously though. My whole life, before i went to college, i was told that was one of my major goals in life. I believed that and believed it was going to be the best experience of my life. I constantly daydreamed about college life: Interesting classes, befriending classmates, living in a dorm, and overall feeling like a responsible, content, fully independent adult.  Ig my daydreams were on acid cuz none of that was real.  It wasn't bad though..it was just school, nothing more.

He was a genius character that definitely should have been explored a lot more.  The One Ship that landed was SUCH a great idea and there could have been a film made centering around that alone and it could have been awesome.
I was only 10 when she died so it never really had any impact on me.  Now that I'm older and have a child I feel so bad for William and Harry. Who have kids of their own, who would never meet a grandmother who would have cherished them.  The thought of my child mourning my loss is heartbreaking...but to be under such scutinity from the entire world? Such an unfair position to put those boys in. I think everywhere would have been compassionate if they'd stepped back and were only present at a private event where they could have said goodbye to their mom.

The brooch my granny gave me while she was still alive. I had an extremely messed up childhood and she was the one singular family member who treated me well and actually wanted to spend time with me. My most fond and vivid memories are from her. I am missing I would say 80% of my memories before the age of 13 due to extensive abuse but I remember all of the time I spent with my granny in perfect detail. I even have a photographic map of her house in my head that is basically my happy place, especially the back yard.  The brooch was a birthday gift. It was two frogs, because she was more obsessed with frogs than I've ever seen anyone obsessed with anything. Her house looked like one of those homes of people with world record collections, but smaller and with frogs. I remember her telling me that she wouldn't be around forever and that she wanted me to have some of her frogs to remember her by. I took that brooch with me everywhere but it fell off my bag on the bus I presume. I only noticed after it had already pulled away. I never saw it again. It's definitely the thing I regret losing most in my life.   Great I am crying now, I fucking miss you Granny. God dammit. You didn't deserve to die so early.

A lot of recent deaths hit me, some hit me pretty hard, but one I haven‚Äôt seen here yet is Grant Imahara. Dude had an undiagnosed aneurism that ruptured, nothing could‚Äôve been done. It‚Äôs so weird to think that someone who was such a big part of my childhood, who was still (relatively, of course) so young could just drop dead out of nowhere. He wasn‚Äôt much older than my parents so it really threw me for a loop thinking about their mortality like that

Honolulu. The oldest part of downtown where the office buildings are like out of a Charlie Chan movie.   So I buy this really cute woman dinner. I met her in class at the University. At the end of the meal she tells me I'm not her kinda guy. OK.    She takes me to this office that she rents. She does not own a business of any kind. She just rents this old office that belonged to a dentist back in 1925. Smoked glass doors, transom, etc.   This office is filled with random Goodwill clothes. I mean thousands and thousands of dresses, pants, suits, etc. Heaped against the walls.   This cloth, it turns out, is a sort of soundproofing. She rents the office and goes there at night so she can roll around on the floor and scream.    It took me a while, but I later surmised that this poor soul was a victim of family sexual abuse.

The baby wouldn't progress, I thought I was going to die. So to save the infant I tried ripping my abdomen open with my fingernails. Everyone just laughed. I died. Baby died.

The story of the tool box murderers who used various tools to torture young girls they picked up into submission to rape them. They recorded most of the situations and the recordings have been used to desensitize FBI agents. You can actually listen to them and it‚Äôs pretty horrible. These guys had a terrible past of mental illness and crime but they somehow stayed out of the prison system most of their criminal careers until they found them guilty of being the murderers in the tool box killings.   But IMO the worst of all was the death of Junko Furuta in Japan. I won‚Äôt get into details because it honestly makes me sick inside. But if you read her wiki you‚Äôll understand. Kids can be unimaginably cruel and destructive. She suffered some of the worst torture I‚Äôve ever heard of. Then to add salt to the wound very little consequence came from it.

I hear what you‚Äôre saying. We‚Äôre in the middle of it right now so it‚Äôs hard to be objective and judge accurately. It‚Äôs like judging a woman‚Äôs actions and behaviors while she‚Äôs in labor. How she acts during trauma isn‚Äôt necessarily an accurate reflection of who she is under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, time will tell us more about who we are.  Also‚Ä¶ we know from recorded history that the idea of marginalizing anyone who is ‚Äúother‚Äù isn‚Äôt new and it likely goes much more to our innate fear of different things. We‚Äôve evolved to keep doing what we know hasn‚Äôt killed us, and change is hard.
The ability to distinguish things like patterns isn't the issue. The problem is rooted in the human condition and how it's warped the passing of knowledge.

Not sure what you consider ‚Äúbig‚Äù but when my wife and I got married we invited about 100 guests, because we wanted to share the day with our respective families and friends, and give them a chance to get together and meet each other.  We did save money on other things.  Decor was minimal, wife‚Äôs dress was reasonably cheap, she made her own cake and bouquet, got our SIL to do photos, etc..    I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with going smaller is budget requires it.  Each of our parents offered to cover costs and that‚Äôs about the budget we ended up going with.  Could have got the price down a lot and just done a backyard BBQ, or rented a hall and done our own food instead of booking at a hotel if we needed to.
Welfare being given to people of healthy body/mind. Bruh my taxes are paying for you to not work. Fuck you, find a job.   Can't find a job? Use that welfare money to learn a new skill. You have an internet connection I'm sure: learn to code, try learning a language, try a business course.   Don't have internet access? Go to a library or an internet cafe.   And you better not be having kids while you're on welfare, either.

Agree, it‚Äôs so misconstrued these days as to what qualifies as mental illness and what‚Äôs normal levels of sadness, it must be exhausting having a life long struggle you‚Äôve experienced be used as an accessory or something to make someone look better, it‚Äôs just adding to the already strong stigma of mental health by self diagnosing and doing things like that, and as you said, it‚Äôs not hurting the person themselves but the people who actually experience mental illness. But I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a conservative opinion, though I upvoted it purely because I agree.

That's a bit of a non sequitur, since I implied nothing of the sort, but I'll attempt to answer anyway:  I feel it would be better if we as a species would move past the archaic, divisive superstitions that have wrought more destruction and bloody sorrow than any other force in human history.   I feel it would be better if we as a species would stop using guidebooks written millenia ago by men with such a clear ulterior motive.   If there is more beyond the physical universe we inhabit (and you might be surprised to hear that I do believe this to be the case) it is unknowable and barely even *conceivable* to us, and certainly not resembling anything described in any book.  Now, don't get me wrong; if faith is a source of strength in your life, I don't begrudge you that.  I don't say all this to try and belittle or dismiss your beliefs, I say all this simply because you asked.

I opened the stall door, and dear god I‚Äôll never forgot what I saw.  The floor was drenched with a mixture of piss and water. There was a single piece of shit sitting on the soggy floor, and a second one hiding in the corner of the stall.  The toilet seat itself had droplets of wee all over it, along with another piece of doodie resting on top, with a few smears around it.  To top it all off, inside the toilet, someone had crammed a half empty packet of seaweed down the centre. There were floating pieces of seaweed and crap surrounding it.  I decided I didn‚Äôt want to use the bathroom after all.

Something that is not necessary is perhaps good within a narrow definition but it cannot be entirely ‚Äúright‚Äù. The rest of the diatribe crumbles. Where it hints at self-preservation and survival, this cannot be characterised as greed. More like desire or yearning for something which still requires effort to claim.

I really enjoy agreeing with old people who want to get rid of socialism. I always suggest we get rid of all the most expensive socialist programs, like social security and government supplements to oil and energy companies to artificially keep prices low. Drop Medicare and socialized police and fire departments, and let us pick our own private security firms to protect us. It always turns out that the most vocal against socialist policies actually use the socialist programs in the US the most.

The Connecticut home invasion murders were extremely horrific. It actually ended up holding discussions in the state about eliminating the death penalty for a period of time.    Two burglars broken to the home of two married doctors and their two children, one 17-18, one around the age of 11. The father was tied up and physically assaulted, the mother was taken to a nearby ATM to withdraw cash. She was then sexually assaulted and strangled to death.    Afterward, one of the burglars also sexually assaulted the youngest daughter, and tied both of them to their beds, doused them in gasoline (while they were still alive) as well as the house, and set everything on fire. The two daughters died of smoke inhalation, but the father was able to escape alive and was paramount to bringing the killers to justice.

I'm sure it always does before something happens. It would also be more accurate if similar things weren't already happening, but whatever. No one cares. Even when these things do happen, it's just shrugged off as unavoidable and unimportant. It's only when something happens to someone that they start to care.   What I dislike most is being stuck in the middle. No one cares because no one has to. It would be nice if we could either solve problems or collapse from them which would force everyone to care, but no, we have to live in such a way where only isolated incidents happen that people can ignore.  A friend of mine went through that Jesus camp hell, so maybe I'm biased.

Some RAM set aside representing pixels.  A DMA process grabs a copy of those pixels, and sends them off to the monitor.  Back in the day, it was sent through DACs and mixed with some analog timing signals for analog monitors, for horizontal and vertical blank and color clocking.  Digital monitors, like HDMI, it's a lot more like sending the image and audio data over a network cable, to the TV.  Anyway, draw things on the 'pixels' in memory, and they're reproduced on the monitor.

I think being calm and having a lot of patience is the best thing you can do. Just learn when they really need validation. I think sometimes it's a habit and sometimes it's an actual need from the person wanting it. Maybe at some point in a good moment try to talk about that matter, understand the motive of that need. Also Therapy, but that's not something you can make them go to. It's just that you can't do what a therapist could to help them. Most people get annoyed and that's understandable, but showing that you're annoyed just makes the need of validation more intense in my eyes.
In molecular cardiology there are "funny" channels which allow sodium to slowly leak into the cell and this action begins the process of each heart beat. It was just funny that this channel was so different from the others.

I take your resume, give you a computer and say, "Show me." It weeds out so many applicants to the point of absurdity.

The pedometer (health app).   Not only does it count your steps, it also keeps a record every minute spanning years. So you can use it to basically automatically record all your activities (in a format that doesn‚Äôt take up much memory space). Like if you forgot what time six months ago you went to the grocery store, it can tell you precisely. Or if you forgot what day three years ago you visited a certain destination you can find out. It can also just be used to store cherished memories of the past or can remind you how your lifestyle used to be at a certain time and allow you to compare.

When I say these women are seeking attention, I am referring to those who 'come out' on social media. If that's something she wants to share with her partner that's totally fine, but unless she has the intention to act on her attraction to women, it won't change anything about her marriage. If her husband is supportive and they decide to experiment with other partners (either together or separately), it is still my conservative opinion that they do not seek attention for it on social media.
Just look up the Marquis De Sade. He's where we get the term Sadism from. His writings are absolutely terrifying.

It was only for large apt complexes and they contracted with a company called valet living. The idea is to have a 30gal trash can for each unit. Garbage and recycle are left outside each door and a "valet" comes by between 6-10pm and collects it. It's loaded in a employee (not company) pickup truck and driven to the dumpsters on site which are locked to prevent residents from loading and creating a mess.   Service was sunday-thurs  The service costs about $30/month per unit and it part of the lease  Valet living is a nation wide company actually  They also provide other services like stocking pet waste stations, litter pick up and quarterly building cleaning for areas like stairs/railings.  It's definitely an interesting and very profitable business plan  I definitely have my grievances about he company and the residents often hated the service but I'm not going to bad mouth them in public

Montana didn't have a speed limit in the daytime on several highways.  They then gave a ticket to a race driver for driving at a speed unsafe for the conditions.

I think there's a distinction to be made between respecting how someone truly identifies and someone essentially exploiting those social changes for laughs/edginess. If someone *truly* identifies as something even less conventional than they/them or xe/xem then who am I to take that away from them. It has no bearing on me at all.  Where it gets tricky is determining who is really genuine about it and who isn't. So I just air on the side of caution and be respectful to all. Again it doesn't affect me at all. I will do my very best to stick to your preferred pronouns so long as you don't jump down my throat the first time if I happen to forget to use them. *Those* people do bother me.

IQ tests became more common during WWII when the higher ups realized matching intelligence to one's task was critical.  An example given was a driver entered a traffic circle and didn't realize he came back the same direction.  He would probably not make a competent pilot either.

True. I was reading how a new species of snake was named after James Hetfield from Metallica which is what made me think of this question. Like, in 200 years when they're learning about the Hetfield snake in science class, will they even know who the fuck he was?  I feel like the last 100 years so many musicians invented genres and styles that have been monumental, but at the same time were invented so close to each other that they might all blur together in history.

My parents didn‚Äôt think I was going anywhere in life, because they didn‚Äôt. So I wanted to prove them wrong. At age 14 I started studying really hard. I got to the top of my class. By 16, I graduated high school. By 20, I graduated college, got married, had a kid, and became an accountant. I try to be the opposite of my parents in every way. Where they are dysfunctional junkies, I live a nearly perfect suburban life.
I guess it depends on what you have done in the ensuing years. Are you now in great shape and successful or are you a meth head?  Has she become a captain of industry or did she get fat and bitter?

Oh boy‚Ä¶  Are you sure? With the vaccine you are pretty darn safe to eat in a restaurant.

Unless you are in some high risk group or otherwise cannot be vaccinated this is as good as it gets, and it‚Äôs pretty damn good.  Keep living in a bubble if you wish or if you need to. If you don‚Äôt need to, my advice is to rejoin society and enjoy yourself.   I personally cannot wait to get back to Mile High for the Broncos in a couple weeks.
What part of it?
My wedding was traditional, but on the small side. I think we had somewhere around 50 or 60 guests. It was a very nice ceremony in a lovely little white New England church. The reception was at a local social club that I was a member of. It was also about as traditional as could be. We had an open bar, but with such a small crowd, it wasn‚Äôt too expensive.  We didn‚Äôt do anything crazy that would inflate the cost, and we also paid cash (parents didn‚Äôt have money to help, which was just fine). That is to say, we planned and budgeted it so as to not incur any lasting debt. My wife is very good with money and had it all figured out, including the dress, the rings and the rehearsal dinner.  So, looking back some quarter century, was our small-ish wedding the right choice? Absolutely. We had the traditional ceremony and dignified reception we both wanted, yet we avoided going in too deep and hobbling ourselves with debt. It was just right.
Dude you killed him hahah
Adrian Jones‚Äô parents. [Story here. ](https://www.fosterfocusmag.com/articles/horrific-story-boy-who-was-fed-pigs). There is videos of them making him stand outside in the cold all night as punishment. Standing in putrid water. Holding his arms above his head for hours. Strapping him to an ironing board. Beat him senseless. The list of cruelty goes on.   Not to mention depriving him of food and water or a toilet while literally trapping him in a makeshift plywood prison cell they created in one of the bathrooms. Once he finally succumbed to food deprivation, they fed his body to pigs they purposely bought for this exact reason. CPS was aware, did nothing. The mother also chronicled the abuse on Facebook saying he was an awful child and is going to feed him to some pigs.   I, a fully grown man, cried in the shower after reading the full story. It took weeks for me to shake the feeling of complete despair and sadness for what that poor boy had to experience at the hand of his own mother.

Your argument works right up to the point where politics are injected into the equation.  When the CDC revises their guidelines for schools (which is hugely impactful because schools across the country follow every word) to please a teachers union, you're argument fails.  When the White House mandates vaccines for all employees except for USPS, it fails.  When the White House excludes those crossing the border, it fails.  When science gets set aside because it doesn't match someone's agenda, it fails.  Remember exposed emails from last year that revealed what the experts were telling Fauci back in April and May, but he chose to disregard them?  It fails.

Not as bad as some monster on here but Lavrentiy Beria.

I consider myself very progressive/liberal/accepting, and I've been trying really hard to change this one but I just can't get comfortable with it: polyamory and open relationships.  I understand that if other people want to engage in *ethical* non-monogamy and everyone involved is fully informed and fully consenting, I have absolutely no reason to even form an opinion on others' relationships, but it just makes me so uncomfortable, and actually kind of sad.  I guess I just always grew up with the idea that relationships should be between two consenting adults and that the exclusivity of it creates the strength and security of the bond.  Openly, I never voice this opinion beyond saying that it's definitely not my cup of tea.  But it still bothers me even hearing about it.  To anyone poly/open/along those lines, I respect your decisions.  I just can't say that I feel comfortable hearing/reading about non-monogamy.

To me it was something i always had with me since the day i learned how to read. It wasn't in the form of writing then though, more of an unsatiable will to read. I tried writing my first fantasy stories when i was 11. They generally ended with me cringing out of my ass the following day so i always ended up ripping the pages from my notebooks. It was until i turned 16-17 when i sent my stories to professional authours after an atelier. You can guess my excitement when my story got accepted in the top four out of 150 stories. The literature teachers at my highschool were incredible people, it really is all thanks to them that i could rebuilt my courage to get my pen in my hand again. I've been writing in an amateur magazine weekly for a year now, and i am graduating highschool as a four year member of the student literary award comitee. One of my articles got published in a professional internet journal and my stories even got published after being awarded in  literary events.  Long thing short, even if it's a gift, writing is a blade you should always be sharpening through time. None would be able to put up a decent text together by sheer talent. Not only that, but seminars can only help to a certain degree, the only way to write is to read isn't it?
Thx
I guess that I'm stuck in one there lmao
"Evil" is a false term created to give direction for morals for humans.  Other animals don't see good or evil, or it's implications.  Dogs for instance don't think humans are evil, even after being beaten, starved, and neglected. Those kinds of characteristics are prevalent in what we would call evil, though.  Morally speaking, mentally handicapped people are incapable of being evil due to genetic defections or medical injuries.  Thusly the terms good and evil cannot truly exist. Evil is your own creation and arguably whatever "pure evil" constitutes as is based on your own morality rather than any sort of scale.  However, given how humans typically are, I would surmise that any individual in a position of power who willingly damages or destroys, maimes, or deprives creatures of life constitutes as pure evil.   My number 1 choice of "pure evil" would have to go to the numerous people who know that the rapid expansion of human civilization as well as the oil industries.  These people KNOW they are making the world harder to live in and they simply don't care. They care more about their precious "money" than the lives of their children or the lives of any living creature.   These people know how global warming is being directly affected by their industry, but they would protect that industry with the ferocity of a caged and wounded animal. They have continually lobbied so they can maintain the course of history.  __THESE PEOPLE WOULD RATHER SEE THE WORLD BECOME A DESOLATE PLANET THAN LIFT A FINGER TO TRY AND SAVE IT__  And that's my two cents.

Business is hard. It takes all your time and effort.  It leaves little room for the other important things in life.  After a while, money gets tight. It is hard to function.  You get tired. It gets aggravating.   The hardest thing to deal with is employees. Many have big egos and think they can do things better.  Without having any skin in the game.  Hard to find good employees.  And then there is owner ego.  My definition of an Entrepreneur is an owner who hasn't failed yet.  Most will, at least once.
It doesn't hurt the middle class much.  Federal estate tax is only on amounts over $11.7 million.  A few states have estate/inheritance taxes, but the lowest exemption amount is $1 million (MA and OR) so only estate/inheritance amounts over 1 million are taxed.  It's framed as something that hurts the middle class because the people who stand to lose the most to it benefit from voters who are opposed to it.

It's sort of a logo for my band I started now... 11ish+ years ago with still 3 original members and our new drummer.  Kind of as a milestone for the 10 years and to celebrate the fact that we now are a band with a full album under our belt. The remixed & physical version will soon be truly released (long story), and I am now so goddamn proud of how I managed to make it sound :)  Am starting the plans of my second tattoo which, compared to this one, is fucking huge and complex holy shit lol

We don't regret our small wedding. My husband and I got married 7 years ago this October.  We decided to do a small wedding instead of the big one we were originally planning (stopped planning at 150 people). I was having anxiety about that many people. And my husband just wanted to get married just the 2 of us at the courthouse. So we comprised.  We got married at the courthouse just the 2 of us. And then we had a small wedding in my husband's dad and stepmom's backyard which was covered in fall colors. We had 30 people including us. My brother was the officiant, my husband's sister and her boyfriend sang, my husband's step niece was the flower girl, and my husband's dad and stepmom's dog was our ring dog. For food we had a potluck with BBQ and our cake was 3 Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes. And then the day ended with a bonfire.  The day was perfect. We wouldn't have changed it.
Big weddings are costly and stupid.

Corporate lawyer who owns a corp. which owns llc that owns my real estate portfolio. You can do this very easily. You need to fill out the paperwork and establish the llc, and then get a bank account to establish some assets. Basically you can transfer title over to your llc but will likely have to cosign the mortgage personally. 1. This will only protect you from being sued by renters or something like that. 2 you wont get a mortgage tax deduction offered to individuals. You want to do this with other assets like a rental property for these reasons. Basically by doing this I pay a corporate income tax rate on rents which would be about 1/4 off the personal income tax rate if I owned this myself.   TLDNR: Probably not the best for your residence. A must if it is an income generating rent for a liability shield and an income tax shelter.

I left a wine opener/pocket knife in my backpack about a year ago. It's got a corkscrew, and a couple little knives, and a mini-saw on it. I've been on a total of 6 flights since then and only realized it was in there because last week on my flight back home a TSA agent finally noticed it. Obviously I wouldn't be able to take over an airplane with a little pocket knife or whatever, but it just shows how horribly inconsistent they are.

I don't want to die or have permanent lung damage or any of the other horrible long-covid issues.  I believe in science and listen to medical experts.  I have a Facebook friend who is a genuine PhD bearing expert in a relevant medical field and whose husband works for Pfiezer.  She and the news reports helped reassure me that this was being fast-tracked due to sh\*t loads of cash and resources being thrown at it rather than due to any corners being cut.  If anything it got MORE research done on it because of all the countries pouring money into it.  I got the vaccine as soon as I possibly could, and I will immunise my special needs son as soon as he either becomes old enough to qualify under the current UK vaccine rules or they lower the age range to include his age group.  I want him vaccinated not just for his own safety, but for the safety of the carers and school staff who work with him, his fellow pupils (some of whom are medically vulnerable), and the other vulnerable folk that the carers come into contact with.  Covid-19 can kill.  I don't want anyone in our family to be responsible for passing on something that causes someone to die.  Vaccination makes it less likely we'll get it and makes the resulting viral load lower if we do, making us less infectious.  I just want to do my bit to help stop the spread of this awful thing.

Might be a little late, and I hope the person that I had this experience with doesn‚Äôt have Reddit. But‚Ä¶  I was, probably, 15 at the time. I was at my Dad‚Äôs house for a summer. My stepmom had these friends who were gay, let‚Äôs call them ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù. Well, A was like this super laid back guy. Was into all kinds of music, which is how we became super good friends. We‚Äôd talk Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper, NIN, all types of music. B was this dry, sarcastic, ‚Äúbitchy‚Äù type of gay man(I really don‚Äôt want to offend anyone) B‚Äôs nickname was ‚Äúqueenie‚Äù. So anyway, A and B are over, we‚Äôre all in the pool at my Dad‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs getting close to dinner. We were all going to eat, then just hang out at this little outdoor fest that was going on.  My Dad is like, ‚ÄúHey, go change, come down to eat, and we‚Äôll go.‚Äù Sweet. I‚Äôm headed upstairs, and B is following me up. He had to change, too‚Ä¶and the other bathrooms were in use. I walk into my room, and B is like, ‚ÄúJust give me your shorts and you can change.‚Äù I kind of froze. Like, he was almost blocking the doorway, hand out, like he expect me to drop trow and give him my trunks. I‚Äôm doing some quick thinking‚Ä¶all the while, B is just standing there, tapping his toes, hand out, looking at me with this serious face. I sunk back a bit. All I could think of was, ‚ÄúIf B touches me/makes a move, I will punch this dude dead in his face!‚Äù  I blinked, and realized, the bathroom is right behind him, and the door is open. Found my out! I let B know, ‚ÄúYo, I‚Äôll step into the bathroom, change in there, and leave my trunks on the floor.‚Äù I grabbed my clothes, and bee lined it past him.  For the rest of the night, B had this pissed off vibe whenever I would speak. Like, he was trying to get something, didn‚Äôt get it, and now‚Ä¶had to let me know he ‚Äúhated‚Äù me.  I‚Äôm now in my late 30‚Äôs, and‚Ä¶anytime my stepmom mentions that A and B are coming over, I automatically have plans for that day so, I can‚Äôt make it.

I guess I should explain that it was a completely random assortment of stuff. She definitely wasn't shopping for kids/family. She was buying clothes, stuff from the garden center, office supplies, one or two pieces of that overpriced patio furniture that you always ask: "why would you buy this from a Long's?" Probably some food and paper products. Honestly, it seemed like a few things from every aisle.  Also, Long's is weird. It's got way more everyday type items than your average CVS or Duane Reade type drug store. But it's also much smaller than a Walmart or Target. So you generally wouldn't go there for back to school clothes shopping (but other school supplies, yes).

I have cystic acne. My very first recommendation would be to consult your doctor, they could provide antibiotics, cremes and in severe cases accutane. When it comes to The Ordinary I highly recommend Niacinamide, which works wonders to even out the skin, reduce scarring and redness. It also gets rid of impurities. In the beginning you might experience a ‚Äùpurge‚Äù, it looks worse before it looks better. It has been like a god-sent for me. I use it both day- and night time. I use The Ordinary‚Äôs Rose seed oil at night as it calms the skin and gives it moisture. Both of these are recommended for acne-prone skin on their website. There are more products you could try, check out their site. They also have a guide for product conflicts, so if you do make a purchase - make sure they dont cancel each other out.
A better end would be the classic zombie finish- with a flourish of hope dashed away right at the end.

Your low score on the WAIS might be due to a lack of effort and/or difficulty concentrating at the time.  I.Q. tests help educators and career counsellors know what you are capable of.

Speaking as a Canadian I've never seen any organized effort to keep non-white people from thriving.  A common comment referring to immigrants for example is, "You wait, their kids will be your doctor/nurse/lawyer in one generation."   The quality of your comment indicates at least average I.Q.

Back in 2018 I went and traveled to my family‚Äôs home country, El Salvador, humid, hot, and lots of jungle where I was staying, I go to visit my grandfather on his small ranch, me, and my mother. We waited by the entrance, there were plenty of mango trees around and I decided to go on my own and pick some. I walk about 20 feet from my mothers location, I spot a mango that had just fell in front of me, I stare at it on the floor walking towards it, the minute I pick it up, we don‚Äôt have proper showers in some areas, so we bathe in stone covers with a large bucket of water, quick context lol The moment I pick up the mango and look straight ahead, a woman bathing outside, no stone walls, no kind of cover, full bush, full grown adult and my 18 y/o mind was blown, I quickly fumbled as quietly as I could walking on leaves and twigs, I had to hide from my mom for a bit till my buddy down south settled down, was coo no one ever knew, though in my mind there‚Äôs no way the woman couldn‚Äôt hear me since I was stomping on twigs and leaves.

This is so odd to me. My main purpose for taking a shower is to get my ass clean.  Being American, I wonder if it's a European thing.  In my travels it seems like Asians and North Americans smell the best. Even the UK citizens seem rather lax and let hygiene go for a few days. I was on a bus once with some English and Scots. They where supposedly "posh'. It smelled like limburger cheese on a hot muffler, in a boys junior high locker room.
Wow. Real judgemental.  Tattoos are much more permanent than sounding is. And just like a tattoo, people who know what they're doing can sound safely.  It's commonly a sex act, and one that, if done correctly, has no negative consequences.  I'd hate to hear your opinion on any sex act that isn't missionary.
Yeah I'm British too, I have the English received pronunciation (upper-class/tory) accent and have been told by many Americans that my accent is sexy/hot and I've come to reddit to find out why people think this

They do and they also consider them fake. Tudor Walkin Jones (Ninja), is from a prominent, wealthy white south African family. He claims to be "zef" which means, in our lingo, "from the hood" or "projects" which as most of us know in South Africa, make the worst parts of Detroit look like a kindergarten.   YoLandi is actually from the hood. He rolled up into the projects and took full advantage of everyone that would go along with what he wanted and because he had money, it wasn't hard for him to gain a following. She was absolutely taken advantage of and brainwashed by Ninja.   The proof Zehani has is indisputable. The videos of him with his young son doing drugs, harassing her and other deplorable things they get their kids involved with...absolutely disgusting. He should be held accountable for his crimes.

We grew up poor and we eat at home most of the time. Going to a fast food restaurant (KFC in particular) was only reserved for special occasions like birthdays, mothers/fathers day, when we do well in our exams. We would even put on our better clothes just for the occasion. When my husband and I go to these places now, I think back on those days and it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Boof it.

> I had told him beforehand he would need a tuner or the bike would have problems after the install.  (This is a legitimate question from someone who doesn't know engines ore bikes.)  What's a tuner and why would you need one for the exhaust? Why does changing the exhaust affect the operating characteristic of an engine? Isn't the exhaust simply there to vent the engine exhaust away from the engine?

They did though; the Americans have repeatedly amended their constitution with the last going into effect in 1992.  Since then, however, the parties have become too divided to agree on something as important as an amendment since the modern primary system has incentivised polarisation (the republicans went first but it would have hit one of them eventually).

The play Mozart and Salieri (and later the film Amadeus) popularized the idea that Mozart's rival, Antonio Salieri, was a huge jerk who ultimately killed Mozart, but in reality there's no indication that Mozart was poisoned, or that Salieri had anything to do with his death. Also Salieri was a philanthropist and probably a lot more decent than theater/film made him out to be when they needed an antagonist for Mozart.

Hello there, my long lost friend!
Bop it
I'm not sure why people fuss about the father's opinion. The baby isn't born yet, meaning it isn't exactly living. It has yet to form any bond or connection to the father, besides it being made out of his sperm. Who is doing the carrying of the child? Who is going through morning sickness? Who is getting the swollen feet? Who is going into labor? The mom. What does the dad do while the baby is being created? Best case, helping the mother while physically feeling the same. It reminds me of how some doctors don't let women get a hysterectomy without husband's permission or already having kids, while men can get the snip with near to no question. And I do feel bad for the men who want an abortion but the mother doesn't. I see a lot of people saying he just should have wore a condom, but those aren't 100% reliable. If the mother wants the baby, she wants the baby and she can be responsible for it. It's like buying a dog without telling anyone and throwing the responsibility on your parents/roommate/partner/whatever. Though totally different case if the mother lives in a place where abortion is illegal.
I think so, I can't be sure of it though
Not saying didn't do it, but the newspaper that published the report saying he admitted she said no (Der Spiegel was the newspaper) was very soon after proven to have fabricated the entire report. Ronaldo has always vehemently denied the accusations and has always maintained that it was consensual. People think he admitted it based on Der Spiegel's fabricated report, which shows how fast fake news travels.

Nah anything smaller than a cup final or an international match and it's absolutely pointless and terrible.

And even if we did it would make absolutely no sense, yesterday in our starting XI we had a Brazilian, Jamaican, 2 Ghanaians, a Croatian and a Romanian, it makes no sense to play it at sporting events unless they're of national importance.

In my experience, the better route is to find specific people who actually seem to take responsibility for themselves and have a level of empathy.  I found one person when I was hospitalized, and one person in the partial hospitalization program that I did afterwords. Mostly everyone else was, like you stated, fairly narcissistic and self-absorbed. But the two people that I found have been invaluable in my own healing, and I think I‚Äôve been helpful to them, too.

By misgendering someone you don't like, you prove that you'll only accept trans people if they're someone you decide is ok.  Horrible trans people are still trans.

Looking at PCs at Circuit City back around 2000-2001.

I was talking to some guy at one of my SO‚Äôs friends Christmas parties I get dragged to every year. Anyway, somehow the topic of gaming PCs and computer hardware comes up and he‚Äôs telling me how excited he is because he just bought the new ryzen 7 to replace his old i5 and how he can‚Äôt wait to get more than 60 FPS on cs:go. I immediately had my doubts about this whole idea of his so I asked him what motherboard he had bought, and he said he didn‚Äôt need a new motherboard, he was just gonna use the same one that was already in the pc as it still worked fine. Even though I tried to explain to him that he would need a new motherboard for the amd processor, he kept insisting his motherboards processor slot would work with any processor and didn‚Äôt want to listen to me as I was trying to get him to ‚Äúwaste money‚Äù. At this point, I didn‚Äôt even bother to mention his monitors refresh rate was probably 60 hz, and that buying a 120 or 144 hz was a must for an increased frame rate. I just went and watched football in the den with all the other dudes and called it a night on socializing.   Note: for clarification, he had 2 big errors in his logic. First, If his frame rate would not exceed 60 flat that signifies a 60hz refresh rate, which means max of 60 frames per second. In order to increase frames, he would need a monitor with higher refresh rate, which he most likely did not know. Second, because he was switching to an amd processor from an intel processor, his motherboard was and intel motherboard, and he would have to go buy an amd motherboard for his new processor for it to work.

Oh my fucking god. I just gave advice not to use this stuff. I did not attack you about your vaginal health or hygiene.  If you want to waste your money on soap with pink packaging do that.

My friend and I  found an amazing hotspring that was free to the public but required a strenuous hike to get to.    Anywho, we knew it was clothing optional and there would be naked folks in the hot springs.  NbD.  What we didn't expect was a VERY evenly and well tannned, mid-60's gentleman in nothing but hiking boots and a sun hat.  At the trailhead.    I don't know why that was so shocking.  We had about 1.5 miles from the trailhead to the springs so I guess it was just so unexpected.    To this day, when either one does something mildly embarrassing we'll say "Um, nice boots."  And cackle like hens.  The only thing I could think of to say when he greeted us.  Lol.

For the most part, it's been great for me. Had my beautiful girl at the start of the pandemic and she definitely is my ray of sunshine in this. Was called back to my old job with better pay and able to WFH and in office whenever. The only sucky thing is I don't get to see my friends from out of town anymore.
And them offer them the whole pack
I had a bad reaction to a new medication. I was staying with my mother, and we had been binge watching I Zombie. I sleptwalked up two flights of stairs asking my mother if she had been bitten, and telling her if she had I had to kill her. Keep in mind I'm 6'4, so if this fugue state had actually been violent this would have been, REALLY bad.  When I actually started to come out of it, and could actually see my mom, I knew I was hallucinating because she had reptile eyes. It took me another half hour of being awake for the psychosis to fully fade and for me to come to terms with the fact that I was not living in a world where zombies were a reality.  The human mind is fragile, and we are all closer to being truly crazy than we think.
As a child I never really knew this, and my dad was a dentist. I always had bad breath and was super embarrassed by it. My friend had to be straight forward with me and tell me my breath stank and why it probably stank for my to realize.

I remember the gay performer too. They called him a bunch of slurs and Yolandi brought out the crocodile tears to say a gay man raped her. She (and Ninja) even *admitted* that she made it up. Ninja called it a great performance. Fucking garbage, the both of them.

Oh, fuck off, Dan. Women are sick of being told that men are magically women by saying they are trans. He is still a man, will always be a man.  Trans women are trans women. Aka, men. Let me ask you, Dan. Would you go down on a trans woman? Suck their lady dick? Unless you are bisexual, the answer will be no. If they've had the full surgery, would you lick their approximation of a vulva? Hmmm?  Also, don't you dare suggest that women with amenorrhea (women that don't menstruate) are not women. Woman is a state of being, not an identity.

I can see how people are going to refuse the vax and get fired and/or be shamed. I agree this will be really stressful.

My situation was similar. I grew up with a single mother and my sister. I vividly remember as a kid my mom telling me to outside and play. I‚Äôd outside and then I‚Äôd hear yelling and things crashing in the house. Eventually my mom and dad figured I‚Äôd be best if they separated. My dad agreed to pay child support and moved to Buffalo, NY and my mom stayed in NC. The only memory I have of my father is him holding me up against a wall by the collar of my shirt because I let my sister paint my fingernails. I was probably somewhere around  3 or 4 years old. I had no idea why he was so mad. I went up to Buffalo to visit my dads side of the family like 5 years ago. My grandad was cool af but I didn‚Äôt really anything to say to my father. I also have like 5 younger brothers and one older brother that I have never met. I think my dad not being a part of my life was probably for the best. I did have to learn some things the hard way though while growing up, but I think that I‚Äôm a better person because of it.

Yea there are jobs without that necessary work involved but usually it boils down to cooks, lawn care, work like that. They like to hire local nationals for mundane work but if they go outside their specified zone or act weird they can be scooped up for questioning. Us naval ships as of currently do not allow people without a security clearance to work on them last I heard. Its technically contracting but those jobs make nothing that the majority of contracts in more technical positions make.
When I was younger and embarrassed about the nature of being a man and what came with that I ended up jerking off in a church parking lot to control my boner. I gorilla gripped that thing to prevent a mess but it was the only thing that worked to put an end to it for at least an hour.  I feel bad about it but I come from a weird background and didn't know how to handle growing up properly. There were so many pretty girls and I was so young that even thinking about naked old people didn't quench my biological loin fire.

Yeah ... it was a very hard transition. At the call center though there were at least co-workers around and that made the monotony easier. When it shifted to working from home it was just me and my computer for 8 hours a day and I couldn't handle that. It's funny because I joke a lot about how much I hate people but I realized doing that job that I am very much a people person. And yes, the tips are another big factor ... its nice to know you are going to have money in your pocket at the end of work and not have to worry about whether or not you will be able to feed yourself that day.

There‚Äôs this idea that doctors are uncaring assholes while nurses are super caring salt of the Earth types, but my ex worked as a mental health nurse and said the culture was pretty horrible among nurses while doctors just tended to get on with things. There was a lot of bullying and not many actually seemed to give a shit.  I got the impression the main clique of nurses just enjoyed having the power and were happy to ostracise anyone they didn‚Äôt like. Things ended badly for her because of this.

It's because fecal matter is air borne and is everywhere. When you smell a fart, there is fecal matter going into your nose and mouth and lungs. Your bathroom has fecal matter coated over all the surfaces.....every time you flush a poop, fecal matter gets blasted all over your bathroom and your home. Fecal matter is really everywhere.
What country, if you don‚Äôt mind saying?
Yeah. Honestly neither country wanted this to be a thing and from a diplomatic perspective I understand why.   I just wish an agreement. Old be reached where she would at least face civil charges and have reprocussions in the states but I don't think it's likely without admitting fault

Utis are bacteria in the urethra.If its still a small amount of bacteria it can be flushed out by drinking alot of water and peeing it out which gets rid of the bacteria. But once its more than a small amount you need anti biotics. If it doesn‚Äôt go away within a day than yeah people need to go to the doctors.
My guess then is that there‚Äôs other issues at play. Use soap, a cleanser, and exfoliator twice a day before applying. Wash your bed sheets every other week. Eat healthy foods.

In some countries, especially very hierarchical societies, you could actually be exposing the recipient-worker to harm, especially if they are lower status and/or a woman/young person. Giving unprompted gifts can have a butterfly effect with many unintended consequences including for that person's safety. If you really want to redress the structural causes of poverty, I can point you in the direction of academic literature and organisations experienced in poverty alleviation and advocacy. You are correct, it definitely doesn't feel right.

Practical things that they may have forgotten at home.

We‚Äôre still trying to come to terms with the end of Postmodernism and the advent of Neomodernism. One of the primary traits of Postmodernism is skepticism of grand narratives. In Neomodernsim, we crave narrative reassurance. The problem is that everyone is building a personal narrative and defending it as universal truth. These personal narratives are sacred to us, and therefore, when people question them, it feels like our very souls are under attack. That‚Äôs one reason why we‚Äôre angry.
Here's a nice video you can watch of what happens.   https://youtu.be/jVAd0BEPRVQ  So, you see when the cup is full, and you continue to add additional water, it overflows.  I think what you're not getting here is that all the ice on the poles is not already "in the ocean." It is on top of a continent..   So, when it melts, it adds to the volume of the ocean..  When you ADD ice to a FULL glass it OVERFLOWS because you have ADDED VOLUME.

38 percent of surgeons in the US are female. Better than the proportion of women on reddit.   You bring up a good point when you describe seeing most ‚Äúeveryday regular people‚Äù as white men with black hair, people you see every day.   Did you anticipate that 1/3 of redditors are women? Like in gaming spaces, women on reddit often opt not to out their gender, and men then often perceive these women as men (as intended).

>But when it comes to rationing, they absolutely should be bottom billing. Not because of the punishment factor, but because the survival of an anti-vaxxer over the survival of somebody who has a surgery postponed is a travesty.  Interesting that you label them anti-vaxxer. If someone has all their other vaccines but has hesitation specifically about the newly released mRNA vaccines, does that necessarily make them an anti-vaxxer?   I love the Covid vaccines but I'm not sure we should label people anti-vaxx unless they are truly against vaccines in general.   I declined a tetanus booster even though the CDC advises them because I was aware that the UK's NHS and the WHO says they're unnecessary. I would hope that I wouldn't be labeled "anti-vax" by doctors (or future doctors like yourself) for declining it.   Thankfully, harmful vaccines are rare, but there have been instances: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html)  Would you have labeled anyone who raised concerns about particular vaccines when they were still new as "anti-vax," even in the rare instances where their concerns turned out to be well-founded?

Still annoys me that he is and was allowed to be on so many shows. Also because Koreans love to cancel their celebrities for minor stuff but he‚Äôs like forgiven because he‚Äôs older/ more wealthy.

I'm agreeing with you man. I understand the lusitania was essentially using the public as a shield to transport munitions. However, that isn't the same level as stopping the lusitania at the Azores, taking all the passengers and munitions off and killing them/hiding them and then rigging the ship with C4, blowing it up and then having the press you control report on it from a prepared script.
That depends heavily on what kind of pen it is.

I was a server once and one of the managers grabbed my nipples (I'm a dude) . It was disgusting,  and I grabbed his back and said "how do you like that you weird fuck" and that was the wrong move cause he said he did. So I ended up pushing him pretty hard into a wall, then yelling loud enough so the whole restaurant could hear "Don't you fucking touch me dude" . Then I told all my tables about it loud enough so that fuck could hear and directly show he's damaging the restaurants reputation. I could seriously throw this guy like a lawn dart but I'm not getting charged with assault.  Im a guy, I can't imagine what girls went through but I wouldn't stand for it if I saw it.

Is it a very specific pen and does he have to identify the correct one? Because you might have enough time to go buy thousands more of the pen at a very nearby shop.   Also, does the detective have to put everything back the way he found it?

I‚Äôm aware enough to know that if you and your elderly relatives are vaccinated, there is next to nothing to worry about for either of you. That is what the data have to say, if you care to glance it over. The chances that you will pass covid to anyone, regardless of vaccine status, as a vaccinated person are very low. The chances that a vaccinated person passes to another vaccinated person are magnitudes lower. And the chances that a vaccinated person passes to another vaccinated person and that person gets severely sick are way lower still. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúscience‚Äù about it. It‚Äôs empirical data that we should let guide us.

I said many jobs. Millions of people. Millions of schoolchildren. Because it was deemed necessary for the safety of everyone. Same thing here. You're OK with some jobs and not others? That seems inconsistent.  Do you believe an employer is not allowed to mandate the conditions of your employment? Because that's employers under 100.  If you're talking about over 100 employees, the mandate allows refusing the vaccine but being tested weekly. In other words, you have 3 choices. Do you believe that mandating testing is also 'control'?

Thank you for admitting being wrong, it is refreshing nowadays you don't really see it, especially towards veganism. If your personal choice is being carnivorous despite knowing most nutrients can be obtained through plants then you do you. Now, knowing that you have mild IBS changes things because even though most meat industry "facts" are myths, I recognize a plant-based diet might not be the best option for you because of your symptoms and food intolerances. Unfortunately, even though veganism might be the most sustainable option (as of right now) I understand it may not be the best option for everyone (due to health issues, etc), and that's alright with me.

That's a difference in application but the science is the same. The invisible hand of the market is present in any economic system, from capitalism to barter. It's like two competing products. They have different features and people will disagree on what is better, but the science that makes them work is the same. Also, keep in mind that economists don't design economic systems or run governments. They study these systems and make recommendations that are not always followed. In the case of the Soviet Union, imagine if the leading economist for the USSR told Stalin that capitalism was the superior system and that they should transition to it. Do you think it's more likely that Stalin would have listened or had him executed as a traitor?

Oh God it was so nice to just not have to worry about anyone contacting you and not giving you a hard time. My mom knew she could only reach me on Saturday morning and that is all I had to worry about. If I went outside I didn't have to take my phone just in case. I do that on purpose now. I go home and put my phone on my night stand on don't look at it until I go to bed sometimes. It's so freeing. I think I am going to do that more often

That assumes credit matters to you. Years ago I walked away from debts. Abandoned a car loan and mortgage and medical debts worth more than the car. Told them all to kiss the fattest part of my ass.  I sold everything I could and had an ok job (this is 2010-11 and job ended in 2012 from budget cuts). Took a few grand cash and bought 4 acres junk land in the middle of nowhere (I was a tribal forester so was used to being in the middle of nowhere). My lot was an old dot rubble dump. I also got a 40 year old junk camper for $200 and just rode a bike or walked everywhere (carpooled to work). Lived there in upstate ny 7 miles from Quebec border and just ignored credit and banks and telling debt collectors to kiss my ass.  Turned that lot into a farm while living in a series of shacks and sheds then saved up over a few years and got a bigger place and built a bigger cabin with barns and livestock and an outhouse and a hand pump well. When the job ended I just became a full time homestead farmer making lots of small incomes selling surpluses.  10 years later I still don't give a shit about credit but my record was wiped clean.

I mean I use hand sanitizer every time I get bored at school (so like maybe 3-4 times per 45 minute class, 7 classes) and I also carry a box of antibacterial wipes and wipe down my desk before I sit down. I wear a mask, but only because my school requires it, I have asthma and it's seruously hard to breathe in those things for me (no I'm not trying to be anti-mask, I always wear a mask when it's required, but seriously there have been times when I thought I was going to pass out because I literally could not breathe). I'm pretty scared of getting covid, so I'd rather not risk it.

Ha! No it doesn‚Äôt. A father doesn‚Äôt go through 9 months of pregnancy and experiences all the crazy shit that occurs. Fathers don‚Äôt give birth and almost die because of it. Those are facts. You‚Äôre just stating complete bull no one is interested in hearing.
Jesus for SURE.  Dude had 12 friends while in his 30s so you know he was friendly and personable. He was a carpenter and the fact that they mention it means he had to be a good one.  Due to the manual labor.... Y'all ever see a Catholic crucifix? My boy is SHREDDED.  He's also not real quick to anger but when some merchants got him riled up, he braided a whip and went back to beat their asses.  Then we have the fact that his best girlfriend was a ho. ICONIC.  Lastly, we have the story of him going to a village, seeing a naked dude and immediately being like, "I'm gonna have dinner with you". THEN SPENDS THE NIGHT WITH SAID NAKED MAN and leaves in the morning after they basically swapped outfits.
Then he‚Äôs flip-flopped because I read an interview with him where he said otherwise. I read multiple sources. If you wanna just pick the one that supports what you believe, be my guest.

I mean, until you fully trust your partner you should use condoms no matter what they‚Äôre on, male or female. The pill only protects against pregnancy and STDs and STIs exists. Part of the trust of going off condoms is also the trust of knowing the person is trustworthy in their birth control. If not, you‚Äôre just asking for a surprise pregnancy.

I want to share a friend‚Äôs story:   One evening him and his family were sleeping, when they heard a knock on the door around 2am. When they checked outside they noticed two police men outside, so they opened the door. The police basically told them that the dad was ran over by a car and died on the spot. As expected the family burst into tears, grabbed their things and drove to the morgue to identify the body. When they got there, they slowly walked to the room where the body was, hugging each other in tears, the people removed the cover. Suddenly they stopped crying and realized that the body wasn‚Äôt the dad. The morgue people baffled told them they found the wallet with the ID on his pocket.  Turns out, the dad went out of town that day and got mugged while waiting for his ride.The cellphone, his wallet and everything he had got taken away. The thief who ran away later got crushed by a car and died. Talking about fucking karma right there.   My friend went to therapy for quite a while.

If they drug effected the sperm rather than hormones. I don't want side effects.   But that doesn't make me a hypocrite because I don't expect women to take the pill. That's on them
But why?
I have been smoking for years and have tried just about every type and form of cannabis. It's important to know this question can't really be answered. Your body is unique and will react differently. In general we discuss marijuana highs on a spectrum from sedative to stimulative. The entourage effect from the unique terpene and cannabinoid profile of the varietal consumed will dictate where in the spectrum the high lands. Sedative highs feel like being sleepy, but not tired. Its most extreme it's called couch-lock because you are sunk into the couch and don't want to/ feel like you can't get up. These varietals treat pain and anxiety. On the other end of the spectrum you'll feel stimulated, creative, energetic, focused, even anxious. Those who have or are prone to anxiety will experience anxiety while consuming these varietals. The cross breeding of genetics has created plants with effects that dot the entire spectrum between these two points. As your tolerance scales up the effects become less pronounced. If you consume more than you're body can process (over dose) you will find a spot to curl and nap. Cannabis nor any of it's naturally occurring derivatives can kill you. If you're interested I recommend going to a legal store front buying marijuana flower and try one or two hits for a whole day. Each time you try it use just a little more than the last time, until you find your sweet spot.
Absolutely.  Assuming it is as effective as currently available options for women, I would -gladly- hold myself accountable instead of relying on trusting that my partner is not lying...yes there's a story there.  I would also strongly support and encourage using it *in addition to* women taking contraceptive and using condoms as an additional layer of protection.
You kidding? Absolutely! Not sure what exactly it would do, and that might change things, but there are very few reasons as to why I wouldn't.

I never said Canada is the most healthy country, I said that you clearly see a difference when you land anywhere in America. Now, in regards to these stats I don't how both countries define obesity but I rarely see the 600-pounds-life ones in Canada. So there's definitely some skewing here or there because in one day anywhere I've been in America, I have probably seen more of those than what I see in 5 years in Canada.

Giving up parental rights isn't easy in the slightest where it's allowed. It took years for my shitty stepbrother to get his ex to agree and sign off. It only worked out because she was remarried and doing well financially.  Meanwhile one of my former friends pays support and never sees his kid because he can't terminate his rights in any capacity other than giving up custody/visitation.   If we had better social programs and infrastructure that actually elevate people from poverty, a good portion of this issue would be solved thru better access to care and prevention - which abortions are a part of.

I wear a belt. My pants certainly won't fall down with out it but it provides a more snug feel plus I feel it looks more complete with a belt in spite of leaving my shirt untucked.   Not to mention, all I wear is jeans so suspenders and jeans sorta clash but I have nothing against suspenders. Of course if I was really in the mood for a nonstandard look, I'd be open to the idea of wearing suspenders with my jeans.

If it didn't fuck with my hormones, then yeah. Otherwise no.  I understand that women's contraceptives fuck with their hormones, I don't know if I'd take it if I was a woman either.
***NEVER CHEAP OUT ON TIRES***  That extra $10-$20 per tire you're saving by cheaping out might seem like a lot up front, but those cheaper tires will wear faster, be noisier, and in certain cases prematurely fail.  I got conned into some cheap tires back 10 years ago.  Within 2 years, 3 of them had blown the sidewall off (one happened first, then the other two happened in the same week).  It was not an alignment issue.  I run nothing but Pirelli and Mickey Thompson now.

If you‚Äôre vaccinated you get 1 entire extra hour of out door activity. They‚Äôre flying helicopters around telling people to stay inside. It‚Äôs terrifying
The "election" of Joe Biden....hes pretty much fuxked up everything hes touched in his first 8 months and now we r a laughing stock on the world stage after his disaterous afgan pull out which has made the entire planet less safe ...he handed over 84 billion worth of high tech us military equipment..placed unvetted afgans all over the entire world...and put the taliban back in power and rebuilt isis and embolden the worlds enemies.  Joe Biden didn that in a matter of 3 days....thats gotta be some kind of record.

Betty White. But I was pretty much inured to celebrity death being a GenX music fan - we lost Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, Shannon Hoon, and then Amy Winehouse, Prince, George Michael, Chris Cornell, etc. I got super sad when Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, bc he seemed like the kind of person we need more of in this world and the worst ones always seem to live forever.
Pure, unadulterated evil.
In my case, it wasn't that I thought I could do better but that I was only beginning to appreciate the reasons I felt we were compatible in high school and that further down the line, after we'd gotten older and more mature, it would be totally clear. I was right.

Not saying that they are the reason for those children going without, but it does not help.

There was myself, my brother in a tent about 25 m away. The PH was about 200m away in another tent on. The other side of the camp. There were 3 or 4 camp staff but they came in in the morning and left after supper. My brother felt the same as I did, the PH claims he slept through it which he probably did. He also assured me it was very unlikely the lion would eat me which did nothing to calm my fears. I did have a rifle but a scoped rifle in close quarters at night is not much of a comfort.

That's more a measure of emotional instability than a measure of a food's quality.
Sounds cliche but becoming a dad. My daughter is 10 months old and my wife is pregnant with our second child. I am full of fear that, for whatever reason (accident, disease, etc) that time with my children will be cut short. I am not scared of much else, but this petrified me on a daily basis. I want to see them grow up and experience life.

I was at work and lowering a steel cable off the side of a building and I had told one of my coworkers to stand on the one end and not move until all the slack was out of the cable. About 30 seconds into lowering it, I had to stop to attach something to it, the guy got a phone call and stepped away while I wasn‚Äôt holding on. Suddenly, I had 300 coiled up feet of steel cable come spooling down the side of the building and when most of the slack came out it spun the structure it was attached to sideways and snapped tight . The cable came right across my face but luckily only hit the little puffball on top of my hat and cut it clean in half. If I were a few inches taller it would have cut the top of my head clean off

I haven't seen it mentioned and I'm too tired of scrolling looking for it, so I'll say: Bojack Horseman! Apparently Netflix didn't like that the studio making it was unionizing,   but the show was so popular that they gave them 1 more season to finish up the story. It was supposed to go longer than it did, and it kind of got a non ending because they didn't have the time they needed to do the planned ending.

I live in Minnesota, and I seem to recall that the "Land of 10,000 Laws" has one indicating that only a barber was allowed to shave a person's head bald. I was in a play where it was easier to shave my head than do a bald wig, but it was difficult to get some areas, so a friend helped. THEY WERE NOT A BARBER.
And the more rural areas are dying.  There is a general migration to more populated areas.  Maybe with remote work becoming more a thing, small towns similar to the old industrial towns can come back.    I love small towns.  They're nice.

Last year, one morning I was looking at my phone when driving my car(yeah stupid). Then suddenly I went off the road for a good 50 meters until I got myself back on the road. Later went to check the spot and I was just 10 meters away from hitting a big tree which propably would have been the end of me. This alone was scary.   Later that day, I got to know that my grandmom had died right around the same time as I almost hit that tree. You can say that was just a coinsidence but for me, my grandmom turned into my guardian angel when I needed it the most.
thanks!
Potentially yes. It merely states that *any* alcohol consumption affects the brain negatively. So fruit would be no exception. However, there is a large difference between drinking wine, and eating say, a banana. Even Non alcoholic beer still contains trace amounts of alcohol in it, but it might even contain more than a ripe banana.   Yes, there are sources that suggest that moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial, However, as I already stated, there are many other ways to gain these benefits, and probably in greater forms too. For instance, light cardio, a few times a week would be more beneficial than sitting back and cracking open a brewski... obviously.   And if you were thinking of "micro dosing" alcohol, then you have already stated that fruits and other foods/drinks already have trace amounts of alcohol in them, so it would still be better to just not do it.

Commented this below as well, but the amount of myths and misinformation sorrounding this breed is staggering, so...  Pitbull biting power is actually surprisingly average. Nearly equal to a Labrador. Huskies, dobermans, bulldogs, and German Shepards for example all have more PSI in their bites than pitbulls.  Pitbulls are also often mistaken for other breeds that do have more powerful bites such as a Cane Corso or Rottweilers, etc.   There are a lot of myths sorrounding them and they're often made out to be villains because of ignorance. They're also some of the most tolerant dogs, right behind labs in that category as well.   https://breedingbusiness.com/dog-breeds-with-the-strongest-bite-force/

If you don't want to believe it then that's on you, also, I have a bridge to sell you. It's in NFT format so it must be valid right?

Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.  She's been the British monarch for almost the entirety of the post-WW2 era. She's as synonymous with "the modern world" as it's possible for any one human to be. She's seen empires wax and wane, including her own, and has been a valuable part of maintaining the current world order... even if only in a small way.  The world will feel very different when she leaves us. Not only will her passing be a sad occasion in itself, for sentimental reasons, but - with a stagnant US and a rising China - i believe i believe her death will herald an end to the current world order.

Hey man, thanks for posting this. I'm 26 and currently waiting on insurance stuff to clear (my awesome extremely successful wife bagged a killer position at a fancy company) to get my balls chopped.   I'm scared of it like I am with any operation. Doubly so due to it being with my bits.   It has to happen, though. While I don't have any illusions about it increasing the frequency of sex or anything, I do think it's the right thing to do to keep my wife feeling good and avoid the awful side effects of BC and the terrible fear of unplanned pregnancy.   We don't plan on having kids and I feel so awful about how this country handles women's reproductive healthcare (if not healthcare in general). It's in a wretched state and I know I need to bite the bullet and have it done. Posts like these make it seem much less daunting.   Anyway, that's the way I want it to go down. I don't want a big interview with the doctor, I don't want to talk with anyone about it, I just want to go and get it over with. Rip those things off like two oblong bandaids.

That sounds an awful lot like my sister. She's younger than me and my parents have tolerated every mean thing she's ever done to me simply because "she's a girl" or "she's younger than you".

Girl here, I would trust both of these above any kind of device.  After I had my second child they pitched me on a this new coil device that would make me infertile surgery free. They put coils in your fallopian tubes and they would expand and create scar tissue and no more babies.  Nothing about this sounded ok to me so I said no thank you.  5 years later there was a class action law suit and now there are thousands of women in severe chronic pain.  This is just kind of a PSA since I was shocked at how they are able to just try and sell you on this kind of stuff without it going through the same kind of testing new meds and procedures do.

No. I don‚Äôt think BC is good for men or women. My personal opinion. I think it fucks with the hormones in the body and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good thing. That being said, I have a vasectomy and that is easily reversible. I did it so my ex wife wouldn‚Äôt have to continue taking BC.

The problem with COVID is not that it uses *some* hospital resources, it's that too many people suffering from the same infectious disease *at the same time* exhausts the hospitals resources. To my knowledge, it has never been the case that a hospitals resources were pushed to their maximum capacity by a sudden influx of obesity related illnesses. Hospitals can handle obese patients because it takes time for obesity to kill. COVID can wreck your cardiovascular system in days.
Now why would you assume that? Lol

No, it‚Äôs not. Basically all studies are showing that sometimes viral loads can be as high at breakthrough but they drop much, much quicker limiting the time of contagiousness.

I'm sorry that our society instilled that fear in you.  Your words perfectly describe the consequences of our collective fear of death.  "All I avoided was was the last chance to watch them live." I'm  sorry for your losses and I'm sorry you are still carrying around that sadness and guilt.    But please let go of the guilt and hold the good memories you have of your grandparents even closer.  And pass on what you have learned about being there for our loved ones at the end of their life to your friends and other family members.    We live and we make mistakes and we learn from those mistakes and we grow and become  better people.  Not all of our mistakes are our own, but result from  attitudes we are taught by our culture.  And fear of death and the process of dying is taught to us.   Be kind to your self, and I hope you can find a way to work through your feelings that lead peace in your heart.

This happened 4 days ago. It was Saturday night and I had plans to go out to the college football game. Before heading out I meet my friends at their place for the pregame (Note: I haven‚Äôt drank for over 6 months but whenever I do drink it takes a lot to get drunk, M22.). I get to his house and probably over the course of an hour me and a friend take 6 shots each. I get to the game buzzing hard and over the course of the game I buy three beers for myself. The game ends, we win and had to go and celebrate.  After leaving the game, we walked to a bar near by where a buddy of mine works. So of course I got free drinks from him and bought drinks through out the time I was there. At some  point at the bar I completely black out, I don‚Äôt remember what happened, who I saw, when we left, I was a complete shit show and pushed my boundaries way past the limits. I think we were at the bar for like two hours before going back to my buddies house.  Apparently we got back to his house it was roughly 1:30 AM and I don‚Äôt have much memory of this but according to my friend, we were just chilling in his back yard winding down, when suddenly I just tell him I‚Äôm walking home. So my not really drunk friends just lets me walk home complete obliterated.  I‚Äôm not sure how I got home where I walked but I have the faintest memory (or dream, I can‚Äôt differentiate if it happened or not) of playing volleyball with random people. I think based on drunk texts I got home at around 4:50 AM, so I have 3ish hours I have no clue what happened.  I woke up the next day and I couldn‚Äôt find my keys or my wallet(RIP), but I had some random person ID on the ground but I was alone in my room. So I had a shit ton of questions like: Did I come home with someone?, where are my keys and wallet, how did I get home and inside with out my keys?, etc. So I was in shambles that morning. So I call my friend to go to the bar to see if my shit was returned. Turns out my keys were but no wallet :/. I later check my phone to see if there was any evidence of where I went and how I got home and I didn‚Äôt find any thing on my phone. I‚Äôm still working to get the other person‚Äôs ID back (in contact just gotta meet them), my wallets gone forever which is so sad cause I have had the thing for over 15 years so it‚Äôs sad to part ways, and lastly I‚Äôm now forever scarred by drinking from how scared I was the next morning of not being able to account for myself for over 4 hours.  TLTR: Drank too much, blacked the fuck out, can‚Äôt account for how I got home or where I was for 3ish hours, scariest night of my life cause IDK what I did or what I said to people

> Often the responsibility of contraceptives is slid onto women because we have pills.

If he's being shitty about condoms, but demands you take the pill, maybe he's not right for you.   You absolutely *can* have a healthy sex life without a shitty partner who bitches about wearing a condom.

Yes. For the reason that female contraceptive pills are such a mine field. Like i dont think iv ever met a woman who has found the 'perfect pill' its always got some bad side effects. Its the least i could do really.  The female pill just disrupts a cycle of hormones in one of a number of ways. This almost always sends said hormones into an imbalance that the body rarely seems to like. A male pill would likely inhibit one of the componant parts of seman which is an ongoing process and have less to no side effects.  Plus my son was born on the pill sooo.... be careful kids!

Well they probably don't trust it anymore. They feel lied to, bullied, and now ostracized. They're called anti-vaxxers so it's easier to hate them even though their reasoning and beliefs are vastly different than actual anti-vaxxers.   Matter of time before this turns to senseless violence.

I was in a HMMWV in the Texas back country when the driver rolled it. Not really his fault, muddy road, bad driving conditions and up-armored humvees had a lot of weight high on the truck.   One moment everything‚Äôs fine and the next you can feel the vehicle start to go sideways. There‚Äôs this lurch in your stomach, and then you‚Äôre off the road, and the tires grab, but only the right side. There‚Äôs this perfect clarity, and I remember just acknowledging that whatever was going to happen was out of my control. According to the driver, I was whooping with joy. Then we were upside down at a 45 degree angle with the vehicle caught against a tree. Then the fear hit. Was everybody okay? Was the unit going to punish us? How was I going to get out? Just sheer, unmitigated panic for about two minutes until everyone confirms that they‚Äôre alright, nobody‚Äôs hurt.   Then you start to figure out what had happened, how to move forward. Shut off the engine, one by one get out the gunner‚Äôs position (only door that you could open at that angle). Worst part was unbuckling the seatbelt and hitting the ceiling. Humvees are full of sharp, hard metal. BFT (a computer in the front passenger seat) sliced open my leg, but then I could sort of slowly crawl back through and out.   In the end, with the help of another hmmwv we were able to flip it upright, and the thing was right as rain. But for those two minutes right after, it was the most scared I‚Äôve ever been. Everyone in that truck was a friend. Some of the best people I‚Äôve ever known. Accepting that you might die is hard. Realizing that your friends might be hurt is panic-inducing.

[https://comicsalliance.com/tribute-william-moulton-marston/](https://comicsalliance.com/tribute-william-moulton-marston/)     The creater of wonder woman is  William Moulton Marston, born 1893, pen name Charles Moulton.  A qoute:     ''Through his psychological research, Marston had come to the conclusion that women were naturally superior to men, both morally and in terms of skill. Further, he believed that women‚Äôs tendency toward loving submission was far preferable to masculine authority, which he viewed as toxic and violent.   Additionally, the goal of the much-vaunted bondage imagery that pervaded Marston‚Äôs stories was two-fold: first, to serve as a metaphor for the oppression women suffer in patriarchal society, and second, to add an erotic element so that young readers found themselves associating submission with love, through what Marston called ‚Äúsex love training.‚Äù''

They want to entrap women into making babies.

Squirting is nowhere near the same as peeing. First off, it‚Äôs involuntary. You choose to pee, you don‚Äôt choose to squirt it just happens (or not, since not every woman can). And yes. It feels good. It is the result of orgasm and those typically feel good.
That makes sense but I‚Äôve met very few black people that believe in reparations where poor people in general benefit. It‚Äôs all about oppressing white people in general who the vast majority wither weren‚Äôt alive or didn‚Äôt have anything to do with them being ‚Äúoppressed.‚Äù All it does it put a wedge into a new generation of white and black people. We‚Äôre all oppressed when it comes to livable wages and access to healthcare. That‚Äôs the real issue.

I think Organization is key.   For example. I have a file folder system that I use. I have a few projects I am working on (programming a budgeting app, a program to keep track of chores., and many more(most of which are still in simple designing stages)). so I have a folder labeled accordingly to enable me to quickly grab whatever I need. which is key cause I often get a lot of random ideas for things, so being able to get what I need quickly helps me write it down (draw it) before I forget it.  other things that help me are naming conventions, labeling things, good desk/office space, and color coding things.  &#x200B;  also tracking what you do is helpful especially your time, For instance I use a couple of apps, one tracks what apps i am using on my phone, and another app called simple time tracker, that I use to track what I did with my time (sleeping, eating, playing games, social media, projects etc.)  one thing I personally believe is that "you cannot change your life until you know what your doing with you life" and I do not mean you know where you want to be in life, I mean where you are right now. so tracking my time helps me to see things like, "I spent 20 hours playing video games this week" or other trends. Simple Time Tracker keeps a good record and lets you see how much time you spent on whatever each week/month/day. so you can kinda see trends in your life.  &#x200B;  Here's the link to Simple Time Tracker  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.razeeman.util.simpletimetracker&hl=en\_US&gl=US

This happened in Serbia in January.  I kind of hit it off with a girl, we hooked up and exchanged numbers.  We saw each other frequently as we were both tourists staying at the same hotel.  When the Orthodox New Year came around, she texted me, asking me to go to her room, but what my dumb ass replied was: "Nah, thanks. I'm good. I've just been out with some friends and I need to rest now."  But this girl was actually persistent and we ended up texting back and forth for about an hour.  In the end, she sent me a message with a pissy undertone: "Fine, go to sleep and rest, good night."  Jesus Christ, had I known what would have gone down back at her place, I wouldn't have been such a f\*cking idiot...

You ever sit in a beanbag chair? Then you kinda shift your body around a little until you get super comfortable?

Whoever set that up had a camp without thorn fence bush like is prominent in Africa and even Australia. This sounds like an absolute nightmare, the kind they make movies about and reminds me of the movie "the jungle".  Alot of similarities. Maybe you have a story there, too. Not exactly normal to have wild lions coming through camp every night. Sounds like misjudgement of the terrain by whoever took you on this trip.

I did.  The whole comment is nonsense.  ‚ÄúGuaranteed‚Äù effects of the vaccine vs the ‚Äúsmall chance‚Äù of getting issues or death from covid.  WTF???  There‚Äôs no ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù effect from vaccination, and the odds of a covid issue/death is higher than the odds of a vaccination issue.  THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF VACCINATION!

To this day I swear I fell and my guardian angel pushed me back up. But I got so spooked I yanked this kid and we got out of there. Looking back I think I might have saved my life and my ass

I can only speak on modern mainstream music, because I've never made an effort to dive deep into newer music.   A lot of popular music sounds very similar. And not just songs, but genres. Pop / rock / country have a very similar sound anymore. Again, that's just popular music of those genres. Mindless, basic lyrics that don't require much thought to get, but with a catchy beat.  Getting more specific, modern country music is pretty fucking lousy. There are so many songs I've heard that follow the same stupid cliches. Cold beer, sittin' on a tail gate, dad or grandpa fought in the war, USA, hot girl with long legs.

The main things wrong with even the first one would be if you suddenly want to have kids and have to get a reversal (Michael Scott's case) or far more remotely (1 in 4000 or 0.025% chance) if the vas deferens grows back together.

Are you willing to listen to your partner's concerns and do you genuinely care?

There's a male contraceptive pill, but it messes with your behaviour, due to the hormones. So no, I'm not going to take it.

I don't remember it, but I have the scars to prove it.  When I was young, less than 3, my father and sister went fishing near a local dam. Now one thing you never do as a parent, is take your eyes of off a toddler.  My dad got preoccupied helping my older sister do something, and woops! I had crawled off the side of the dam.  He heard me scream my way down, and jumped in after me. I was extremely lucky. I had suffered almost no injuries. The doctors were amazed!  Then again, I've been to the dam since then a few times, and it's more like a bridge to be honest. I think it's supposed to be some sort of backup emergency flood gate thing in case the water breaches the big power generating dam upriver. (Though that one doesn't produce electricity anymore, so it's just a plain old dam now)

i'm all for abortion rights, but men have zero post conception rights to control their reproductive capacity.  in every other area rights and responsibilities go hand in hand.  if a woman has more rights to control both individuals post conception reproductive capacity, it should follow that she also has more responsibility for the decision she makes.

It‚Äôs right now. I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease 15 years ago and have spent those 15 years seeing a nephrologist every 3 months, eating a ridiculously strict diet and follow all medical recommendations. I got evicted from my house in south Texas (thanks child killer Abbott) and had to move in with my brother 250 miles away. For a month now I‚Äôve been trying to get a new nephrologist. I could tell my kidneys weren‚Äôt doing well so went to an ER in a teeny, tiny west Texas hospital. They did some tests and said yep, you‚Äôre at end stage renal disease (ESRD) which means I need to be starting dialysis ASAP.  However, all the Nephrologist‚Äôs have cut back their clinic hours in order to be at the hospital to take care of - anti vaxers who decided risking COVID was the way to go. Now those jack asses have filled the hospitals and every doctor in town is hard at work for long hours trying to save the chronically stupid from themselves. I can‚Äôt see a nephrologist for another month. I‚Äôm furious and terrified. Will I live another month without medical assistance. I guess we‚Äôll see. Child killer Abbott, I‚Äôm consulting an attorney tomorrow. College dropout tucker Carlson, your name might come up as well and certainly faux news. U asshats are literally killing people and I hate u all.
There's absolutely no public healthcare and hospitals are for profit? Like wtf?

I always wondered about this question and im not religous or anything but the theory i think makes sense to me and is believable is that as soon as we die we are born again.

The answer is always, "Yes, it's a joke."
I'm one of the hospital pharmacy staff who goes into a high sterility, negative pressure room to make IV bags of all kinds. We take care of every patient in the end, but when we have to drop everything to scrub up and put on full garb to shoot STAT remdesevir, RegenCov (monoclonal antibodies), Nimbex to keep your lungs paralyzed so you don't fight the pump, etc., I can't help but feel some animosity towards these people who work against us by going unvaccinated/unmasked, and then they rely on our care. They are holding up everything else for patients who don't have Covid, and they're STILL, even after last year, making it unnecessarily difficult (to say the least) for anyone working in a hospital.  What I like least about it is seeing how little people really give a shit. And I see some of them at death's door when I go up to ICU on deliveries.

It depends on how many versions survive, and how they compare to each other.  We have copies of works written by Flavius Josephus, who lived between about 40 CE and 100 CE, though I could be off on that by a few years.  That was the general era though, so he was writing around the time Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans in 70CE, only 40 years after the alleged death of Jesus.  Some versions of his writings mention Jesus, or have references to his apostles, but other versions do not, leading some scholars to believe that the versions mentioning him were altered by later Christian writers during the process of recording them and preserving them over the centuries.

Actual sex education,  not just teaching abstinence.     Teach life skills, how to change a tire, balance your babk account, use a credit card, taxes, ect.  Trade skills for those who want to learn, basic computer science wouldn't hurt either.  Increase the teachers budget so they aren't operating on nothing, it's ridiculous.   We expect ppl to teach and yet pay them next to nothing.  Then we complain about how undereducated kids are.   And finally stop letting politics into classrooms.  Kids should be taught the full political spectrum from capitalism to communism and everything in-between.  Not as this is good, that one is bad, but ad facts.  There is capitalism,  this is what it is.  This is socialism, this is what it means, ect

This one time, when I was 15 or something, I got contact lenses. It was the second day, and I was still only wearing them for an hour or two at a time, like the optimetrist recommended. He walked me through it, showed me how to insert and remove them, clean them, gave me great advice, he was great. I was just a noob. One of them wouldnt come out, so I ended up fumbling around on my eyeball to try and get the thing. But of course, it slipped up under my upper eyelid. I spent about half an hour poking around before I finally managed to rub the damn thing down, my eyebal looked like a tomato. It was fine in the morning, and I took a day to let the irritation go down. But oh my god it felt good to finally pull the damn thing out, it hurt a lot, eyes are sensitive.   Still continued to wear them daily for about 7 years.

You know you want a rhino in your logo and you want a name based on that and not your product/service or anything else that‚Äôs actually useful? What‚Äôs with all the people lately asking questions that shouldn‚Äôt even be asked in this sub.
Yes but the energy and matter disperses after we die. It‚Äôs no longer together, like you said, and so it‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúus‚Äù. It‚Äôs only a part of us while we‚Äôre alive and together. The togetherness is what makes it unique and what gives us consciousness. So yes, we are always a part of the universe and that gives me great comfort, but those pieces of us that float around after we die aren‚Äôt stamped with our knowledge or personality or our soul.  The other stuff - the DMT experiences, the children recalling past lives (which is actually very infrequent and almost always unconfirmed), and the thoughts of repeating history sound nice and almost poetic in a way, but there‚Äôs just no good evidence that any of it is true. I‚Äôve read up quite a bit on DMT and listened to some podcasts about it and it‚Äôs all super interesting, but it all comes back to an experience that someone had while taking drugs. And some experiences that people have directly contradict other experiences that other people on DMT have also had, which right there tells me that it‚Äôs unlikely that there‚Äôs some deeper truth there.   In any case, all of these anecdotal stories that people have for an afterlife or rebirth or the process of dying all occur within a functioning brain. Whether it be from DMT, or a near death experience, it‚Äôs all happening in someone‚Äôs brain. But we‚Äôre talking about what happens when that brain stops functioning. And of course, we don‚Äôt have any stories from people who have had their brain stop for periods of time, so its just difficult for me to conclude that there is any good reason to think there‚Äôs something beyond that based of the knowledge we currently have.  And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would *love* to be wrong on this. I love thinking about the kinds of possibilities there could be for an afterlife or rebut thing process. I too have considered the idea of the same personalities just recycling over and over. It‚Äôs a cool concept. I don‚Äôt think it could possibly be that simple (our population growing exponentially would create a need for ‚Äúnew‚Äù personalities over time), but either way I just don‚Äôt see a reason to think that it is or could be true. You acknowledge that and say that it‚Äôs just a feeling that you have, and I know that‚Äôs a super common response with super natural beliefs and a response that I used to give too. But when I truly asked myself why I had those feelings, it usually came down to what I *wanted* to be true as opposed to actual truth. I think that (and religious belief/indoctrination) are probably the main source of those feelings for many. There is mystery in our brains, our lives, our deaths. But we are also one species on one tiny planet in one small solar system within a larger galaxy which is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in our universe. Are we the only special ones that get an afterlife? Does every living being have an afterlife? Do ants, for example, have an afterlife? Why or why not? How about the alien beings on a moon hundreds of billions of light years away? Our lives are amazing and precious, but almost impossibly small. I think there is an obvious desire to exist forever in all of us, I just don‚Äôt think the evidence is there to back it up.   Thank you for the response and the conversation, I very much appreciate it!

As a young woman, there‚Äôs been a lot, especially growing up, and much of it is repressed, but the thing that always stands out when this question is asked is when I was about 12 years old, so had just entered into high school in Scotland. Girls were made to wear a dark blue polo shirt, form fitting black shorts, and knee high socks during physical education, (boys wore similar although they were permitted to wear baggy white shorts or joggers) Though not where near as sexualising.   Anyway, we had PE last outside this day in particular and I was helping return the equipment at the end of the class, and this group of lads on the balcony of the school watched me climb the stairs with my hands full (was carrying large traffic cones) and one of them ran up behind me and pinched me in between the legs, I screams and jumped in the air and he and his friends laughed, and unfortunately I was too shell shocked to tell the teacher who just missed witnessing it happen.

When I was a kid I would have this recurring dream where I was running up a flight of stairs that went on for eternity. The further up I went the steeper the stairs got. Eventually, It would be too steep for me to climb and I would fall and the feeling of falling would wake me up.  Think about it all the time.

Honestly, the bars in the Harvest Moon franchise. All of them are different, and even if the theme is similar, are unique based on the game you play. I think it would be a lot of fun bullshitting with the characters you grow to love while playing the game, and would love to try multiple types of drinks the franchise has 'created', in particular moomoo milk.  In saying that the names are quite innocent, but they are alcoholic drinks (even if they aren't outright said in a lot of games for the sake of rating).

It takes me a long time to realise I'm pissed off at somebody after they've wronged or slighted me in some way. In the moment I'll either not know how to respond or I might not even have noticed it, but by the time I figure it out it's too late to react or it's too petty for me to bring up again.  Difficult to explain that, haha. But that annoys me the most, I wish I was more confrontational. Immediately call people out, clear the air straight away and get over it, that kind of thing.

Was naturally like that, since no one is born believing in a religion. Never found a religion I could believe in. Tried Christianity, didn't really buy it, saw the massive hypocrisy there, and then looked farther back, and realized that there were thousands of deities worshipped before christ, and It made no sense that this one was right, while all the otheres were wrong.  Tried Odinism and couldn't believe that either.Tried looking into Judaism, couldn't buy that euther. Tried hellenism, same thing there.   I thought I had to believe in a religion because everyone else I knew did, and I came to point where I was just done trying. Hypocrites everywhere in religious circles. Everywhere. Judging others because they didn't believe the same thing they did. Missionaries and preachers telling everyone they'd be punished for not believing, no matter how good they were to others.  The above problems really weren't that present in Hellenism and Odinism, which by themselves had their own problems, often being tied to white suptemacy.  I just finally was done with it, and there was no benefit to me either way, as I was already a good person, and if I was going to be punished for not believing, I didn't want to praise that deity anyway.  Never bought it, but tried to.
When I was about 4 years old, before I really learned how to swim, I was on a pool float. I was being babysat by some of our extended family. The adults went somewhere else. I remember the last adult telling me to just stay on the float and sincerely agreeing to do so. Then I got uncomfortable and shifted just a little and the float dumped me. The water was about a foot over my head, and this pool didn't have a shallow end, stairs, or a ladder.  I looked around under water for a second then decided to try jumping to grab onto the float. I tried to reach the float a few times, but each jump was a little less successful. I wasn't even able to break the surface the last two times.   I remember feeling panic when my lungs started burning, but it was brief. I was holding my breath, looking up at the sky and sun through the water. Suddenly, I just felt very calm and peaceful. Like everything would be OK. When I couldn't hold my breath any longer, I opened my mouth. I saw the bubbles rise past my face as I felt the water rush in. Then nothing. In my next moment of awareness, I was waking up, completely dry, on their couch. No one ever talked about it or said anything. Only the crystal clear realism is why I'm certain it wasn't just a dream.  Whenever anyone has asked me those "would you rather" or "how would you want to go" questions, drowning is how I answer. It's fast. The pain and panic only last as long as you can hold your breath, if even that long. But it's that sense of total calm and peace that I'd want to have in my last moments. The process of dying itself concerns me far more than what comes after.

Sorry to say, even with family you would get zero help. (4 x Executor here two with no wills!)
I too find this take on death to be quite possibly true. I've tried to just dismiss it as nonsense or mere wishful thinking, but it just keeps on returning to my mind as a genuine possibility. I'm convinced that if you do lose all sense of time that the moment experienced after this loss would basically be infinite in nature and length. So while you actually die soon after losing your perception of time, you would be completely unaware of it. As far as your perception goes, you'd be forever conscious and present in such a timeless moment. It makes sense to me anyway, but I admit that I am quite possibly totally wrong. After all we're not really very well equipped to understand or even conceive of existence without experiencing time or infinity.

I don't believe in ghosts or anything. But The human body is made of energy, and that energy has to go somewhere when you die. Any time I feel a presence or a bad vibe somewhere I'm positive someone died, I'm almost certain it's little more than leftover energy from where the body died.

When I was 15, I got into an argument with a friend.  At the time, there was a lot of drama going on at home, and this friend wanted to know the details.  After he kept badgering me, I told him just so he'd shut up, and I made him swear not to tell anyone.  However, this escalated into an argument where he kept insulting my mother.  After he ignored my warning to stop, I lightly kicked him.  I barely touched him, but like a bratty little sibling who got smacked for annoying his brother, he whined to another friend and exaggerated what really happened.  So, I got kicked out, but he thought I hadn't suffered enough.  So, he deliberately told my other friends the dark family secret I told him in confidence from earlier while I was locked outside begging him to stop.

Micha≈Ç Drzyma≈Ça.  There was a period in history when Poland was occupied by Russia, Austria and Prussia (Germany). Prussian authorities wanted to overtake the Polish land, so they supported Germans settling on Polish areas but denied the Poles the right to buy the land or build a house.   So, mister Drzyma≈Ça bought a circus wagon and made it his home. At that time, Prussian law assumed that a dwelling was a house if it was stationary for more than 24 hours, so he would just move the wagon every day, thus avoiding any penalties. Bonus points of making fun of absurd law and annoying the occupants.

A wooden railroad beam takes first place. A toothpick takes second place.  The beam had a bit of wood jutting up I didn't see and I accidentally kicked it with my bare toe while walking down it. This ended with me being held down while someone pulled my bloody, broken toenail off with a pair of pliers. I was maybe 9 or so? I was left with a fear of open toed shoes and sandals well into me twenties as a result.  The toothpick happened when I was 17. Dad dropped one on the floor. The end of it caught on my sock. The other end caught in the carpet. It speared straight up and drove itself halfway into my heel. About a third of it broke off inside and stayed there for a month before I could pop it out like an infected zit.

I had just starting dating this woman when one night she invites me over to her place. Her roommate was there so I thought we were just going to hang out for a bit. She decided that we should go out to go buy some weed. On the way there she says that her roommate is leaving soon and she should be gone before we return. Then she says "when we get back we should have the place to ourselves so we can smoke for a bit and then you can fuck me..." I look at her and she's got a grin from ear to ear. She laughed at my surprised face because I wasn't expecting her to be so direct. It was a good night. That was the first time we had sex. Too bad the relationship didn't work out. We broke up after about 4 months.

Why carry out such a waste of money and life as that when you could just compare Texas and Hawaii, their policies and the results ooooorrrrrr Florida and California while bearing in mind the size of Florida's elderly population and the predominantly younger population of California üôÇ  Compared to the UK or Canada- yes Sweden disregarded this pandemic and your fear mongering. Ask around how much of their population masks up, kid,

Do you think the op only wanted answers saying "I don't know"? They're clearly looking for opinions since it's obvious that nobody knows. That's why the question is asking for what people *think* happens.  It's ironic that you're accusing me of splitting hairs when you're essentially just trying to get everyone in the thread to preface their answers with "I don't know, but here's what I think".

I'm 10 days post op ACL surgery. I feel as if my hobbies of being outdoors and active have been stripped away. I can't walk without crutches and things like cleaning my room or getting a cup or tea take 3x longer and more energy. Everybody who asks me about my injury usually ends the conversation with, "that really sucks." The building my classes are in have stairs and no ramps and I have found myself a bit embarrassed taking one step at a time, holding up the rushing students behind me. I've been through this injury before so initially I felt I could certainly handle it with the experience gained, not the case. I am really struggling. I try my best to be grateful for what I have, and be aware that this is a temporary experience, and will pass.

as a gay man who was raised in a heavily catholic house and school I didn't face anything. nothing you stated is true in the slight least.  people treat you different if you're different. doesn't make it right but it's life. they preach love and acceptance. never a single person can completely follow what they preach in this world but they try.
In that context it's not bad as long as you tell them they are doing well already. It's more of an insult when combined with things like "if you would just apply yourself."

Well, no, if you 'actually die' you don't come back. That's really the definition of actually dying. If you die for a short while and then come back, that was a near death experience, and it happens we know kind of a lot about those. And again, the first guy was saying there's a lot of evidence 'if you bother to look into it with an open mind'. That 'open mind' part is really just a dog whistle for uncritical acceptance on the basis of feelings and desires.

That is where the "Janteloven" comes in handy here in Norway, it's basically a set of rules deeply ingrained in our society that can be summed up with; "you are not to stand out from the crowd" and "whatever you are good at there is someone who is better at it".   It helps to keep us grounded in reality.
My bumper I got for my cruiser was about 150 on ebay, granted that was like four or five years ago lol, I couldn't imagine them being that much, it wasn't painted yet but it was primed and ready, I just left it black cause my cruiser was red and black.
When I moved to a different city and enrolled on a nearby school, I thought that everyone was a bit on edge but couldn't put my finger on it, I was really curious so I started asking around. No one wanted to tell me, but after a while, a guy finally told me what was going on.       Apparently there was a teacher in that school that raped a bunch of girls in the changing room almost daily and one of the students killed him in the bathroom. No one knew who the student was, and despite the investigations, the police never found the person. The students were all afraid of going to school and getting killed, because they thought that if they knew anything about it, the person would kill them too. I probably was putting myself at risk for asking questions around, thankfully I graduated with no issues.

Didn't work at Disney, but at another worldwide theme park doing pretty much the exact same thing (parts of the job were very much to make us more like Disney).  Highlights I remember was when I was with one of our characters (who obviously can't talk) and I was trying to get a kid to hug the character and they got confused and gave me a hug (very very heartwarming) and also at Christmas working as an elf in the Santa's grotto when father Christmas would ask the kids what they wanted for Christmas and then the parents faces when the kid said something they weren't expecting.  Strangest things though are when the parents try to get you to admit there's someone inside the costume when you're within earshot of the kids and get quite persistent about it (obviously you can never admit that the characters aren't real), or when it goes the other way and people completely forget that there's someone in the costume and basically let their kids assault the character (especially as alot of the costumes aren't the easiest to move in and are quite top heavy), to the extent that one person I was working with got sexually assaulted in costume while I was working with her.

Around 2010 onwards there seemed to be a rise in witchcraft related tortures and deaths in the UK. I never saw them but reading about them was horrible. Torturing and killing people to get out evil spirits.   Not long after reading about a 15 year old boy being killed I was stuck on the underground, the train had stopped and this one woman would not stop going on at her pastor about how her husband's ex wife had killed someone back in Africa (sorry cannot recall the country) and she was sending evil spirits and curses to this lady's husband. She wanted the pastor to give them the lord's protection.   I don't care about your colour but culture and religion are terrifying.

You know, I've thought about that a lot.  Got into karaoke about seven years ago, and I haven't even once heard someone try a Stevie Wonder song.  I've only ever heard one person attempt to sing one, and it happened locally during the BLM marches.  A woman set up and sang Love's in Need of Love Today, and fucking blew it out of the water.  Like even the police stopped what they were doing to just listen to her.  Which talks both about the quality of her rendition and just the power of the song by itself.  I try secretly in the shower sometimes, but his range is just too much for me.

Big fan of Sign o' the Times and it was my preferred album for a while but I've liked Purple Rain for a while now. What can you say about Prince other than he was a genius who was supremely talented.
i mean isnt it obvious they arent going to tell the public everything? its reasonable
He did something similar to another song of Stevie's and damn if I can think of the name of the song at the moment. Iirc, Lindsey and Stevie were at his house to record a song and both got to drinking. Stevie left before the song was finished. Behind Stevie's back, Lindsey 'finished' the song himself using the parts that Stevie had sang. I don't recall the consequences of this however.   I think Buckingham is a whiny ass hat. I like his style of playing guitar but as a person, he sucks.

Me and my mate drank a mixture of Whisky, vodka and rum. 10 minutes later we fell out of our truck(he dropped his phone out the door and decided to reach for it while sitting on the seat and I was trying to hold his arm so he wouldn't fall out. We both ended up falling out. Then we danced along the street listening to folk music lmao
In my opinion Metallica didn't make a single bad song before Load.

Failing exams. Exams are high stress environments and you're unlikely to have to perform tasks equivalent to an exam in your daily life. That's not even mentioning that some people will have difficulties which heavily affect one subject whilst they excel in others. You are not your exam results and, no matter what the school system says, you can do well later in life by going down other routes.

Camping in the Sequoia National Park for a week with a group of high-school buds, at the Lodgepole campground. A bit of underage drinking and up late talking shit, we got hungry and starting grilling some Carne asada, somewhere near 2 am in the morning.   One of our friends walked into the the darkness to grab something from his car only to sprint back and jump over the camp fire we had going and started shouting at us.   In disbelief, he tells us about nearly walking into a black bear just outside of view. Out of the 6 of us sitting around, I was the only one left sitting across from the table when opposite of me the bear in question appears between there and the fire pit.  The rest of the guys immediately freaked out and sprinted back into their tents, making a commotion that seemed to distract the bear. Me, with a little knowledge of the subject choose not to run away and give this animal cause to chase.  Well, not sure if this was the best course of action in hindsight. With all the food sprawled across the table and only me in the way, this 6 ft boy stands up a let's out the huge type of roar that you hear in the movies. He belts out a good one then slams his paws on the table, all whilst I'm still sitting across from it, sitting very still. It was at that point I said, alright it's time to go, I slowly walk away and retreat into my tent for minute.  While peeking through the door flap I observed this huge hungry bear grab only a pack of flour tortillas and run off with it in its mouth and disappear within seconds.   We quickly wrapped things up and shoved all our food away in the storage locker at the sight and spent the next couple hours making a bunch of noise and scaring off the reflective eyes that kept popping up on the fringe of the campfire glow. That was one sleepless night. Good times besides that.

I really enjoy cooking, and there‚Äôs one particular dish that I cook because it‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs favourite, and I love it too. After a busy day at work, I‚Äôll head out to the vegetable patch in my garden and pick the best looking onion that I can possibly find, along with the plumpest tastiest bulb of garlic. I‚Äôll then dice them finely and start the magic in a saut√© pan, on a medium heat, with some fresh, locally-produced artisanal butter and maybe a little olive oil, pressed from specially selected olives grown by a dear friend near the beautiful Italian mountain village of Picinisco. Once the onion and garlic begins to soften I‚Äôll add one carefully prepared organic chicken breast to the pan, delicately cut into cubes. Once the chicken is nicely sealed I add a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc to the party to deglaze. As the sauce reduces I pour a glass for my wife and take it to her to enjoy while she cuddles with our cat in front of the fire, the stress of her day beginning to melt away.  Once reduced, it‚Äôs time to add half a pint of chicken stock, and reduce again. The garlic bread enters the oven as I pour a cup of double cream in, adding the perfect amount of salt, pepper and more chopped garlic for the final round of careful reduction. The sauce is complete, and married to fresh homemade tagliatelle it tastes absolutely exquisite, enjoyed further with the rest of the wine.   Now the best smell in the world‚Ä¶I have developed a bit of an intolerance to lactose over the past few years, and I love garlic but it seems to produce a wicked reaction in my gut. The dish tastes wonderful, but my proudest creation, and the best smell in the world, is the absolute wallpaper-curler of a fart that inevitable comes shortly after. Everyone loves their own brand.  TL:DR - a recipe for success.

Unfortunately the crust recycles, even though the Earth is 4 billion years old, the crust mostly only goes back about 500 million. There's entire ancient continents detectable in the magma, forever buried and being recycled .  Any fossils that were on/in those continents are lost forever.
I have watched many snuff videos. Mainly to see how someone died, so I can avoid ever doing that in my life. I‚Äôve learned to never work in China , never sleep with someone‚Äôs spouse or lover, always be on high alert on the road, and to just never go to the South American drug countries. The cartel videos are the worst ones out there. Far worse than any taliban videos, African war torture videos or anything really. The cartel are absolutely brutal. Watched a dude get beat to death with his own severed legs, watched a dude get his head repeatedly doused in gas and set ablaze while sitting up still alive. Just down right terrible. I mainly watch work place accidents anymore (to learn to avoid those mistakes) but sometimes a cartel vid sneaks its way in and I always regret it.

Such a stupid accident and in one second lives were changed forever.   Something about it hit harder than any torture video or anything like that. The fact that life is so delicate and fleeting, all it takes is a split second and you're reduced to a pile of meat, coupled with the terrible screams of agony as the person in the video realizes what happened...   I've (24M) had a rough life, and I'ts not easy to get an emotional response out of me most of the time. I only saw that video recently and it made me fucking cry.

I was a young teenager exploring best gore, and I saw a video of the aftermath of a wreck I believe where a mother and her little girl were in the backseat of the car and they were both in the process of dying. I remember being so upset that nobody was helping them and just had cameras shoved in their faces.   Second place goes to 3 guys 1 hammer, that one still makes me sick thinking about it.  I also once saw some videos of people skinning dogs and cats and putting them in boiling water, whilst still alive after just being skinned, they were drowning in boiling water and were obviously in shock and couldn‚Äôt move. It was terrible.
I said disingenuous, not dishonest, interesting though how you assumed I said dishonest.  And you were being disingenuous when you did not admit that you yourself are a sore loser, as evidenced by your discussing your own mediocre stats in a situation where there was no need to discuss them, as the topic was about starter FPS games, not your own stats in games. (As I said, one can be sore without complaining).  That is a bit of projection, since it's clear it was on your mind when you referred to the person in this thread as a sore loser.  That's why I said you were being intellectually disingenuous.

Daft Punk - Discovery  I'm a fan of all Daft Punk's work, and my personal favorite album is Homework, but I will readily admit it's not for everyone, and some songs, while I love them, are frankly skippable when you aren't in "the mood" for them.  However, as soon as Discovery gets going, it doesn't let you leave "the mood" for the entire hour that it's on. Discovery is one long and perfect ballad, and is only better supplimented by the anime feature film Interstella 5555 produced alongside it by Leiji Matsumoto, creator of Captain Harlock.  RAM is good, check it out. Homework is good, check it out. Alive 2007? Please, it's like Daft Punk is jerking you off with fan service! How could you say no?  But Discovery? Perfection.

I think it‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs lost, but what he‚Äôs gained: modern sound production software. TFOTL and the albums that came before it were mostly made and mixed on analogue hardware, physical samplers and drum machines and synths that required a shitload of manual handling to use.   When Liam switched to using Reason for Invaders Must Die, suddenly he had the ability to produce at ten times the speed with ten times less hassle, and I really think that that freedom is what ruined his unique sound.   Every artist knows that necessity is the mother of invention, constraints force you to think outside the box and be very deliberate with your thoughts and your actions, and I think being handed everything on a platter took away that base creativity.

So, this goes deep, but I'll try to give you a readers digest...  Kind of Blue introduced a series of harmonic and improvisational concepts that didn't previously exist (they did, but no well respected artist had codified it yet).  Essentially, jazz (which was mainstream popular music)  to this point largely centered on fast moving harmonic progressions: chord changes in quick succession, and navigating them fluidly was proof of high level musicianship.   Kind of Blue utilizes what is now referred to as "modal jazz". "Modes"are the various incarnations of chords and scales that exist within a major scale (there is more to this but we will stick with this definition for simplicity). Basically, what happened on Kind of Blue, is that the chord progression would sit on a single chord for a significantly longer amount of time, 8 to 16 to 32 bars instead of one. Sometimes more.   This allowed for and forced the soloist to explore the harmonic possibilities of that single chord and create melodies, riffs, themes that pushed the music forward, instead of bouncing between chords every second and trying to build connectable ideas that are largely driven by the structure of the composition.   Basically, the harmonic difference allowed high level improvisers (John Coltrane, Miles, cannonball adderly) to create complexity on the fly, instead of them working through and navigating the built in complexity.  It was a total conceptual shift.   The impact? HIP HOP. Rap DOES NOT exist without this album. The riffing and textural elements of hip hop are directly rooted in Kind of Blue. Like...a direct lineage. Modern music does not exist without this album, period.

I was conducting a cell search and three cartel members "trapped" me inside the cell by blocking the entrance. One of them held an improvised knife (shiv) and the other two proceeded to try to interrogate me on what I was taking.  I took off my utility belt as a show that I wasn't going to back down from a fight, an in doing so slyly triggered the panic alarm on my radio while simultaneously making it look like I was shutting the radio off.  When the three saw that I was willing to fight to get out, they actually backed down and let me pass... of course by the moment, about 10+ officers were rushing to my location because I wasn't responding to my panic alarm.  Far as I know, they believed my reinforcements showed up because the bubble officer (camera watcher) called the emergency after not being able to contact me on my radio and never knew I had secretly summoned a small army to rescue me in the event of being jumped.  They even told me they thought it was "pretty gutsy" that I didn't back down while in the cell, and from that day onward I never had any problems with them or their group.

Hanged is one it is to completion. When being hung, drawn and quartered, you aren't hung to death, you are pulled off after passing out of just before passing out. The hanging part is only to create pain and suffering and to prolong the torture. The condemned are still alive for having their guts drawn from their body cavity and if the executioner is really lucky they will be barely alive for the quartering. I really hope people didn't live past being drawn but their must have been a few. Mexican cartel videos show you can skin a man alive and use a meth IV to keep them awake and alive. I don't know how even the cartels do that stuff. Nobody starts off being ok with doing that, you have to do a lot of fucked up stuff before you get to the point of some of these torture videos. It makes me sick people do that and I honestly wish I could go to the Canadian government. Form an anti cartel armed security black water style force and literally go to war to stop these murdering animals. There is nothing more that I would love to stop the cartels one firefight at a time.

But when you're "young" (under 30) doctors tend to tell you have time and won't propose your the more efficient option/treatments.... I had to tell them that yes I was young but I wanted 2 or 3 kids, if it takes 3 years of treatments to get pregnant each time + 9 month of pregnancy + let's say 18months before trying for the next one,  I'll menopaused before.

Craigslist can be bad at times. Especially the shady people. There was one time that somebody was asking for 1 million dollars for a ps3. Not to mention that the guy wanted you to pay that in cash in person. Like, how am I gonna get that in cash? Am I going to rob a f\*cking bank? I'll probably get robbed if I show up to that deal.
A lot of these albums are really good, and even better than TK, but you don't need, or want, to skip any song on this album, and that was the question.

About 7 days before I was back to normal, happened recently and I‚Äôm not gonna drink again for a while.
I used to live near a large open stormwater drain with no fencing around it. Three drunk guys drove their car straight into it. I went out and found the driver trying to get his friends foot out of the windshield. On the field on other side of the drain I saw the third passenger who was covered in blood. I asked if they were ok and my neighbour called the ambulance/police.  The blood covered friend passed out and was twitching so I ran to the car, grabbed a towel from the back seat and ran to help him. I found a large, deep cut on the back of his neck/head. I rolled him to his back and used the weight of his head to put pressure on the wound. I was talking to him, trying to keep him awake and he went into shock, twitching and unresponsive.  This was the moment I thought an man died in my hands. I was able to wake him and the ambulance took over from there. That was the most harrowing moment of my life

one of the reasons DSOTM is so great is that its a perfectly complete package, from the artwork, to the the total album length.   That some people aren't a fan of on the run i can understand, but that they would rather break that package and live with a 0.5 second gap by skipping it is unfathomable to me. Its only 3:40 minuts as part of a 43:09 minute experience.   The Bells on time hit much better if you are building up to and anticipating it. Instead of initiating the song yourself.

Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.

My partner and I just look at each other and say an elongated Hi,  if we get an elongated hi back then it's go time. A "Hey" in the same style means "I'm not up to sex but I want to have some fun". The addition of "there" to either a Hi or Hey alters the connotations to "I'm not quite sure what I'm up for exactly but I'm happy to find out", but still within the context of the original prefix. The suffix "sweetheart" changes it to an "I'm not interested in anything tonight".

I've started to realize that just because I'm not "depressed", doesn't mean I'm happy.  There's a limbo state and I'm pretty sure I've been there for several years.  I work hard to live in my drywall box, feed myself, and pay all of the monthly constants like gas, water, taxes, electricity, and after that there's not much left.  Haven't had a scheduled day off in two years.   I don't connect with people because it's full of hate and division and I don't feel strong enough to pick one side or the other.  But yet I have it better than most because I have a job *AND* a drywall box to live in.  I should have had a midlife crisis a while ago, but I think I was too busy working and I missed it.  Right now the worst thing I can think of is living into old age.

Since then, no "tar" and I don't remember the last time I coughed until my teeth were sweating.   FWIW: These are 100% my opinion, based on my own observations üòä

It is implying that girls are normally not likeable and different from me in a bad way and that i stand out from a crowd of undesirable girls because im not like them and that is why you like me. Why am i different from other girls? What is wrong with other girls? Are you stereotyping girls to be bad? Cant girls be nice and likeable?   I think no girl is like other girls, all girls are different and that is why i am just like other girls - Unique.

I wish the latter argument would die. It's an old fashioned trope that brushes homophobia under the carpet without addressing the genuine issue of homophobia. I'm not saying it doesn't exist. Of course there are homophobes who are in the closet. But it's not true for all. Homophobia is an issue. "They're probably gay themselves" dismisses the severity of homophobia.

> Second, there are instances in which reconciling differences isn't good. This might not be one of them, but it also might be. Reconciling differences isn't intrinsically virtuous.  No, but it's intrinsically pragmatic. If there are enough people who hold to an ideology, they have to be dealt with, unless it's "the hill you die on" and you're willing to segregate society. Maybe we should split into negative- and positive-liberty societies. The problem is that as I see it, we've been moving to positive-liberty almost monotonically for the past 150 years or so.

Alright now.... I'm all in favor of vaccines....  But let's not pretend it's the physical pain of the needle that these people are scared of.
Yup. At least that is a private school so to speak, so if you wanted to technically you could go somewhere else (or if yojr parents wanted to) Many public schools do the same shit but the parents are uninvolved with the PTA and can't or won't pull their kids or make changes. It's so important to vote in local and school board elections and school budget elections because of this. For a Catholic or private school it would be much harder to change where the budget is going. I assume there is a board of regents or some shit

A pro tip from someone who has been dealing with hardcore anxiety and depression for a while now and getting great professional help: don't spend energy fighting against negative thoughts and feelings. That's not to say you should let them take over, but rather accept that they are there, they are temporary, and they don't define you as a person. Getting too attached to feelings and over-identifying with them fuels them. Allowing them to come and go and acting as a passive observer takes away their power.  Easier said than done, but you could probably cultivate this level of mindfulness by meditating and practicing it over the course of like one month.

I guess it really depends on how you grew up. I live in Canada, where it's expected they'll check on you occasionally. Maybe a European would find it annoying, but to me it's normal. On the other hand, when I was on a road trip in the US, it felt like they checked on us every 2 minutes and I didn't get any breathing room to just enjoy myself. I understood that it was supposed to be a positive but to me it was horrifying.

The hospital protocols. My father had to have emergency open heart surgery in November to save his life and we couldn‚Äôt be there with him at all during his recovery in the hospital. That was the hardest part for both him and my family because we was alone and miserable. And then my Grandmother was diagnosed with Brain Cancer in December and we couldn‚Äôt be in the hospital with her when she was diagnosed and she was all alone when she was told she had a terminal illness. Sad stuff man.
Pack in the reverse order you plan to unpack and do it by rooms. So if you need the bedroom stuff 1st (and you do another pro tip- you'll want a place to sleep instead of laying on a mattress on the floor at the end of the day) it goes on LAST. BONUS: give yourself enough time to pack/unpack. You're not going to pack and unpack that box truck when moving a 4 bedroom split level in 4 hours. Rent the truck for longer.   Extra Bonus: bathroom supplies including a junk towel should be the 1st thing you put into your place. Trust me.
I guess it depends on the introvert. I have lots of hobbies but none of them serious. I just like to tinker with stuff and get lost in whatever I'm doing.

Years ago, my wife and I were driving on the expressway that was under major construction.   Traffic had slowed quite a bit and I saw a plume of smoke ahead.  As we drew closer, I could see it was the beginning of a Carbeque, but the driver was still in the vehicle.    I did a death defying move to cross multiple lanes of traffic to pull over, despite my wife‚Äôs protests about being late to the event we were headed to.   I approached the car, which was just starting to produce visible fire from the wheel wells and opened the door to the car.    The guy was conscious, but in obvious shock and was unresponsive.     I had to reach in to unbuckle him and pull him out of the car.    Within seconds of me getting him out, the driver‚Äôs compartment was completely engulfed in flames.

Whore
I lived in an apartment complex and next door lived a woman with her 3 kids (one was 8 or 9 at the time and the other two were 4 or 5 yo twins).  One night their dad was there watching them while she was at work, and one of the twins fell off a bunk bed head first, straight onto a piece of Lego which pocked a hole in his cranium. We heard cries and screams, so we went to see what had happened and I called an ambulance for the kid while his dad was panicking. When they came and took the child to the hospital, dad went with him and I stayed and babysat the other two kids until 2 or 3 am (i put them in bed but they were scared and the little one was convinced his brother would have died, so they didn't sleep). When the parents came back with the kid (who was thankfully fine, nothing major had happened), the mother started yelling at her ex for being such a shitty father and nit being able to take care of the kids and accusing him of hurting the child on purpose and all that stuff... Right in front of me. I had to stop her and say something along the line of "OK guys, I'm going home, night", and she didn't even say thank you for staying and watching my kids, nothing at all.  The sadly funny thing is, she was yelling at the guy for the accident because he was 'a shitty parent who can't raise his own children', when she was literally working as a prostitute (during the days and nights off of the legit job) at home, when the kids were there in the next room. Cops and social services kept going to her apartment and she always pretended not to be there, and I also know she was doing everything in her power to prevent her ex from seeing the kids unless she needed him to babysit them.
R/stopdrinking is a really great resource if you're looking at cutting back. I've had a less-than-ideal relationship with liquor for a while, but the pandemic kicked my drinking into overdrive. Reading about other people's experiences and better understanding how heavily my drinking was affecting both my mental and physical health really opened my eyes to how important it was for me to get a handle on my drinking. I'm still far from where I want to be, but I'm on the right path now, and even just lurking the subreddit has been a huge inspiration as I continue to work at sobriety.

We already do that.  It‚Äôs called sports.
I didn't say that the league would require *looser* clothing, though. That was what the coach in the OP comment required.   I'm not trying to diminish any valid athletic reasons for some clothing. But yes, it's just high school. Schools and students generally aren't trying to optimize away the fractions of a second the way professional athletes are. I don't think the looser pair of shorts suggested were so baggy that they would inhibit movement. But even if they were exceptionally baggy, it didn't seem to affect the NBA players in the 90s in any noticable way. Some of those guys gave an incredible performance even though some of them looked like kids trying on their parent's clothing.  To underline the ever-evolving clothing in sports, it's fairly well known that not all sports and all leagues make clothing requirements because they "work best" for that sport. For example, [The Norwegian Olympic volleyball team protested the clothing requirements earlier this year specifically because they didn't feel comfortable according to their personal or athletic standards *and we're fined for it!*](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/norwegian-women-s-beach-handball-team-fined-not-playing-bikinis-n1274453)  While I agree that people shouldn't objectify the students OP mentioned, the coach would be complicit in their behavior, if not enabling it, if they were to do nothing when they felt there was a valid concern.  The creeps *should* have to change their behavior. *YES!* But they aren't always readily identifiable and in the absence of being able to do anything to treat the root cause, it's valid to treat one of the symptoms.  I wasn't meaning to suggest that the OP community was collectively clutching their pearls over the uniform requirements, but that, generally, different communities, even in the same conference, may have different general comfort levels with clothing...and I think that's okay.

If you tell me that the guys surrounded you and harrassed you or someone showed you a knife, there was a genuine threat and I feel great sympathy for you.  If I were physically present, I would feel an obligation to put myself in danger to support you.    The sexual part is irrelevant.  We ALL get harassed, bullied and insulted -  especially as children.  As adults, we get judged and gossiped about.  Your brain is 100% your own space. If you choose to replay thoughtlessness for hours, I have no sympathy for the mental stress you create.    I guarantee you that the guys at the job site did not remember a thing that they said twenty minutes later.  It was thoughtless,  pointless, witless humor that took a tiny fraction of the mental effort to say than you're spending replaying it in your head.      In my other comment I point out how little these guys have going on in their lives - they work construction and don't have expectations for climbing any social or financial ladders. Society expects little from them but a strong back.  So let them have their fart jokes and jokes about getting horny and get on with your life.
Children.
I feel for the old folks that were unwell before the vaccine or couldn't get the vaccine due to health concerns, but I have no sympathy for those who willingly want to put their family in danger.

Had one day to clear out my Aunt's apartment when she got evicted and was in Mental Care. I felt so bad for what I couldn't save, but there was a lot that I just couldn't move or box up in time. If I had more PTO and a more warning, I could have saved so many things.

People seem to equate safety of others as authoritarian abuse for some fucking stupid reason. Probably due to selfishness and the whole idea of individualism that has been shoved down our throats since Reagan and the deregulation of everything. Of course personal choice! Freedumb.
Not brushing one's teeth and neglecting basic hygiene is a very common trait for those suffering serious depression.

I talk with dozens of people evey day (clients) and every one of them is somehow mentally just kind of listlessly grinding it out.   No spark, just a sort of group 'blah', at best, and even immediate family they're all just sort of grinding it out.  Mental health issues.  I don't think it's a mistake that we're seeing strange behaviour that is obviously a lot of brainwashed folks but also just - everyone almost - is quite mentally 'taxed' these days.
No government body may exempt themselves or any other government entity from any law they pass.   This would force all legislatures and elected officials to suffer under Obamacare, and force all government employees to survive on the same social security benefits instead of the taxpayers being forced to support cadillac health and retirement plans for government workers that are not available to the people who pay for them.

I've had 3 pitbulls and they have been the most loyal, loving and gentle dogs I've ever had, and I've had quite a few in my life.  The irresponsible and/or  cruel owners are the ones that need to pay for the attacks they caused with jail time, yet the dogs get put down and the owners walk away and do it all over again.  So sad and tragic.
The darkest shit... a vaccine that dont really work, giving bad side effects and even causing death sometimes, and no studies on long term effects but the government and media CONSTANTLY urging you to get it, with little to no mention at all of alternative medicines, weight loss, fitness, and eating better.

Democide.  I started suspecting a few years ago that  that's the form eugenics would take.  Wage stagnation.  Increased housing costs.  Oxycotin being unleashed globally.  Infrastructure rot.  The precarious gig economy.  The datafication of daily life meaning we work for free, and no one's begun to put in place a serious alternative use for us once enough data has been siphoned from the privatization of our inner lives to replace our jobs (many interviews with former FB and Google staff forecasting it will be 95% of jobs although they told public only 85%). Death by neglect could go on almost invisibly with how distracted, overworked, over-medicated the population is.  The pandemic just made its possibility seem more obvious.  But...we did matter.  When we had to stay home, it brought the world economy crashing down relatively quickly.  Skies were clearer.  The air was fresher.  We aren't just disposable.  The Trump admin projected as loss of 200-300,000 was acceptable in starting the economy back up.
People's reliance on social media has grown and its pretty shitty.

I wasn't happy at all. Like I said not something I wish on anyone. It's really sad what happened. I feel bad for his family and the lives of everyone involved as they had to deal with that trauma BUT did I cry over his death, no.      The shooting was the classic "Haha look at my dad's gun" point and pull the trigger thinking it's not loaded while hopped up on coke and who else knows what. They panicked due to being high AF and dumped his body on the front door of the hospital which by then it was too late.  (or at least that's the version I was told).

There is evil in the world because people choose to bring that evil into the world.

The witch thing bewilders me.  I don't know what happened during covid lockdown but suddenly all these girls I've encountered lately are going around claiming to be witches.
Can I get some extra credit?
No    I went to 6th form (16 to 18 education) and after that I discontinued education. I've never worked, so it would have been pointless for me. I took a gap year just to exist and do what I wanted, and after that I've been a stay at home mother.
Um, no. That‚Äôs not the weird part. Why are you making it weird?
It is less about the privacy or confidentiality (although that is an element) and more about the reliability or trustworthiness of the process.  If you are truly interested I would be happy to go into more detail, but a short way of putting it is you know what people are/aren't doing when they are in the jury deliberation room.  You don't have that assurance when people are on Zoom.  For example, jurors can't use outside resources to learn about the law or investigate the case.
I agree, I vape former smoker, my work doesn‚Äôt monitor breaks at all just as long as your shit is done so this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve seen in person, but in companies where smokers do get extra breaks, what is stopping the non smokers from just taking one? Or if anything, buy a nicotine free vape and pretend to hit it?
I like the semi-free system some service stations have. Throw a quarter in to turn the pump on and it goes to charity. If you're in a pinch and don't have change, just ask the guy at the cash register and he'll turn it on for ya free of charge. That is like the most friendly, easygoing system I've seen for air pumps.  To this day I still avoid the one gas station that wouldn't help me when I was almost flat.   Wouldn't turn the pump on. Wouldn't let me take cashback on my debit card. I had like 10 bucks in the bank so couldn't use the ATM but offered to buy something if they'd let me debit am extra few quarters for the machine. I was at just about the lowest point in my life that day and that place was not having it. I almost left my car in their lot just for spite.

Mine is:   You can catch a cold if you don't wear a coat in cold weather.   1) It takes coming into contact with a virus to catch a cold virus.   2) It is 100% false that being cold wears your immune system down. Your immune system only reacts to something that invades your body. Study after study has proved this.   3) Cold weather actually kills viruses. People get sick more in the winter time, because they are indoors more and in near contact with people who are infected.

My mother‚Äôs uncle. He was abusive to his wife who my mother loved and still talks to. he paralyzed himself while riding a dirt bike and blamed it on his wife because she asked him to leave and he said no, so he was apparently ‚Äúrushed‚Äù so he crashed. He told her everyday how he hates her and that she did that to him even though she was trying to take care of him. She left him eventually and that was her fault too of course. He just eventually died of old age alone and lonely and bitter because nobody wanted to take care of him or seen him.

Someone was trying to kill me, they were chasing me with a knife or something, then all at once I realized it was a dream. I woke up... except I didn't, I was still in a dream but didn't realize it. I went outside and that same person came running at me and by god I ran again. Thing is, again I realized a dream "woke" up, except into the dream, and this time, more people were chasing me. And the cycle repeated I have no idea how many times, and the #s of people after me growing and just the locations changing. When I really woke up I was so shaken not knowing if I was actually awake or when they would come for me.

My wife is a first grade teacher in a low income school district. Many of her kids during the year of remote teaching fell behind. Internet issues. No family at home during the school day. There is going to be an entire generation of school kids that will never catch up. These pivotal years of education can have a dramatic affect on the types of lives these kids will live.
Rhetoric, Oration, and Public Speaking.
It's super frustrating. The divisive atmosphere since the pandemic is driving me nuts. Words like "communist" and "fascist" are being thrown around super flippantly by people who disagree with each other and I'm not even sure most people who use those words s insults know what either of those things actually look like. It just causes further division and resentment. Social media has certainly exacerbated it, and I think it's led to a lot of distrust, accusatory behavior, and a lack of listening ears when someone actually has something important to say. This goes for all sides of the political spectrum. If you're a doctor in Texas that's being sued because the government didn't deem an abortion of a fetus that didn't develop kidneys or lungs medically necessary, there are people calling you a liar, trying to tear your reputation down, and even calling for you to be sent to prison or be executed. If you're someone who legitimately witnessed voter fraud (it happens every election) and you want something to be done to safeguard people's votes, people are screaming that you're a Trump-loving liar and a racist. Nobody listens to what other people have to say anymore. There's no middle ground, and everyone just assumes that if you're not one extreme then you must be the other and it is so destructive.
True but nothing was ever done to figure out how to return plastic to the natural cycle of biodegrating, and yes i get the petrol component but this was known ages in advanced. No one ever bothered to factor its return to nature and instead let it turn into 5 gyres of trash in every ocean. If plastic had to exist, it should have been relegated to health and manufacturing only. It wasnt. Now the planet is dying, or more specifically the planet is cleaninv us off of it, along with all the plastic.

So what's a classic then? Everything is shit to someone. Zepp and Skynnyrd and the gang are just derivative garbage sung by tortured cats, listening to Nirvana or Soundgarden is like chewing on tinfoil that was dipped in something rancid first, and every popular 80s synth-driven party please is the aural equivalent of a drive by shooting... to someone.  So define your standards for a classic: I figure tens of millions of albums sold and a couple decades of intervening time to see if people still feel strongly about the music is sufficient. What are your criteria?

A couple of additional details to share.  Not sure if I'm doing anything more than thinking out loud, but maybe this is good additional context.  1. I work in the tech/web development area of a company in the travel industry.  Over the last few years, during a merger/reorganization followed closely by a Covid-related furlough and layoff, a big chunk of my job type at the East Coast HQ were laid off.  My Midwestern team has taken over a lot of responsibilities that used to be handled by the higher paid HQ people, who are no longer with us.  2. Accordingly, we've already had one payscale upgrade for my group. But it was handled badly:  the "floor" and "ceiling" for my job type were increased significantly. So if you were at the bottom of the scale you got a nice raise to the new minimum. If you were at the top of the old scale you could start getting raises again, which was also a benefit.  For those of us in the middle, we got essentially nothing.  Barely a percent increase, which was not nearly as much as was indicated previously.  Morale took a hit, and I've heard rumblings that management want to recover from the loss of their reputation.  3.  I was scrolling LinkedIn over the weekend, and saw an article written by an executive career coach who openly disagreed with the concept of reducing salary for the same job type based on lower-CoL geography. The reason it came through my LinkedIn feed is because the post was "Liked" by my fifth-level boss, the one who made the overpromised announcement of the *last* payscale upgrade.  Maybe that constitutes ... "repentance", for lack of a better word.   So I'm hopeful. But I've been burned before. I guess you could call me "hopefully pessimistic".

Anybody online who says something against the social norm. It‚Äôs one thing if someone has ideas that make them a complete POS(racists for example) but a lot of people who try to explore lines of thinking that go against what is considered socially acceptable are shit on without any consideration toward their view point.

I was catching bullpen with a misaligned nut cup. Meatball pitch from a freshman bounces in the dirt and hits me right in the cup. *THAT CUP WAS RIGHT OVER ONE OF MY NUTS.* Was doubled over in the bathroom for over an hour. Threw up. If it had been an actual varsity pitcher doing it instead of a guy who threw 45 i might have lost a testicle. Worst pain of my fucking life.

Her Instagram had about 1,000 followers before she went missing. Many of my real life friends have around that many followers on Instagram and it really doesn‚Äôt seem like their followings are engaged enough that they would notice and spread word of they didn‚Äôt post for a week. I used to have niche social media accounts with around 2,000 followers. One day I just stopped using them and I had maybe a few messages from mutuals asking where I went, but no one created waves.  I think she had a very average following in these modern times.

I swear obesity rates must be way on the rise.  Not as a result of having Covid but more of a result of isolation, and likely depression/anxiety.  I know a few people who have gotten into better shape since the start of this...but I know plenty more who have gained their "Covid 19" (and thensome).

Sorting socks is such a goddamn nightmare that I refuse to ever own more than one 'type' of sock, just so I don't have to do it ever again.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics  All part of the tactic. "The book emphasizes that Russia must spread anti-Americanism everywhere: "the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S."  In the United States:    Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements ‚Äì extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics".[9]"
I have no idea actually.  If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say that most people don‚Äôt actually fail out: I‚Äôd consider that to be actually being kicked out by the university itself for poor grades.

I understand why you feel that way, but the problem with looking at individual cases is that is opens up doctors to be sued.   If your doctor didn't induce you on that second time and you died in labor because of it, your family could sue the hospital for malpractice.   Liability is the driving force not convenience.
> Basically, the response to covid has been far darker, bleaker and more dangerous than the virus itself.  The virus has killed a few million people and left millions more with likely permanent disabilities.

It‚Äôs kind of fuzzy in my mind but I think I remember when I was about 5 (1995) I had a two piece. But it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsexy‚Äù two piece. It was neon pink and green and the bottoms were full briefs and the top was like a short, flat tankini top? Almost like a bandeau with wide straps. Covered plenty but there was no mistaking it as ‚Äúsexy‚Äù. I loved it because it kept me cool but I was also reaching an age where I was becoming aware of the differences between girls and boys and knowing I should cover up my ‚Äúprivates‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt seem weird to me then or now, but would you think something like that was weird? Just wondering if that cozzy was I guess. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell when it involved yourself.  Thankfully haven‚Äôt seen any bikinis on kids or at least not noticed any, but it would be mega weird to put a kid in a string bikini. Like, they don‚Äôt have breasts, stop implying they do.
My son was 2 years old when this all started.  He turns 4 next month and really has no friends because no parents wanted to take there kids out during the pandemic.
I'm single since October 2019. I'm never about jumping straight into another relationship, especially after the last one was a deep love. It ended because of visa issues in post-Brexit Britain (fuck the Tories).  I decided to try to give myself until Spring/Summer 2020 to start dating. March was going to be my month.  Sucks but I'm not feeling sorry for myself. We'll get there.

Definitely not trying to understate how difficult this is for people stuck on either end of this spectrum. But again, the risk in your case would be that the defense can be convicted, then can argue something went wrong with the zoom jury, and there‚Äôs a chance their conviction would get thrown out (so, retrial).    I agree there are completely manageable logistical solutions, but the right to a trial by jury is a really intensely protected one and the cost of something going wrong (or even appearing to go wrong) can be really, really severe. Healthcare is undoubtedly a deeply personal and private thing, but there‚Äôs just not the same risk on the ‚Äúramifications if something goes wrong‚Äù side of things.

Came here to say this. This happens fairly often, but most recently I went in to Lowes with my daughter to get some things, and this old man that worked at the store felt the need to stop us to tell me that my daughter is "really beautiful".

You just said what I said. You missed the part where I actually stated "Steve Irwin, wasn't researching, he was trying to get good footage of the stingray for his documentary when the attack".

My coworkers GF once said something to the point of the Holocaust being a good thing bc population control.

Same. No pain, just the aura.  Started in high school for me, usually after gym class. I would be changing in the locker room and I would "see" the aura manifest on my peripheral vision. It would take like two-to-three classes for it to migrate from "one side of my eye" to the other side and then disappear "over the horizon."  Whenever I get them, I just have to take a nap for a few hours until I'm fine.  People thought I was crazy when I described what was happening to me, especially teachers. It was until I learned about migraines and that some have visual auras and some of those don't even have the pain typically associated with them. Just this swirly, trippy, white-noise aura.

I grew up in a small town that is well known for having a racist past. When I was around ~11, I can remember having racist, homophobic, and all around judgmental thoughts. It was all I knew. Not that my parents taught that, but they didn‚Äôt teach acceptance either. As I got older, I was more exposed to the things that the culture deemed wrong. At 14, I‚Äôd completely flip flopped my ideology. While I let the people around me influence and shape my opinions when I was young, I‚Äôm proud to have built critical thinking skills and developed empathy in spite of it.
I think because of people having weird reactions to parents being affectionate with their adult children

It may have a small chance of killing you but it has a scarily high chance of leading to long lasting damage. Plus, a small death rate has still lead to a death count in the US of more than the US military death count of several wars put together.
Maybe we do talk about this some, but the absolute isolation in medical situations, and I mean far beyond just Covid cases. I have had two babies since the pandemic began, and my husband couldn‚Äôt attend my appointments. He would have missed their births as well if he had contracted Covid. Then, my child recently had a non-covid related medical emergency that required her to be put on a ventilator, and I had to make that decision alone in the ER because they only allowed one parent. Nothing like having to facetime your husband so he can get a last look at his daughter before she‚Äôs put into a coma.   They tell parents that it takes a village, but a looooooot of the time now, it feels like my village has been ripped out from under me. The isolation is depressing and scary and overwhelming.
It's been a dream for me

Pros: more equality, everyone has a job and contributes (without judgement on their type of job), education is more attainable for everyone.  Cons: without a quality leader it tends to devolve into a dictatorship. You also have less individual rights.
And this is why men who are victims of sexual assault never get justice. This is why men are much more predisposed to suicide and sexual violence. This is why men are tortured, drafted to military, pay alimony, and are overall pieces of shit. Men like you who create the myth that they're superior persons and refuse to acknowledge the systemic flaws of our society.  I hope to never meet you and I hope no woman or man ever get to smell, see, or hear your vitriol. Men are better than this.

If someone is afraid of Covid then they need to stay home. Either vaxxed or unvaxxed. When I got my vaccine my doctor told me that even the vaccinated people can spread it. I‚Äôm not afraid of it. I keep my distance from people, practice good hygiene, etc. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had four forms of cancer in the last four years that this just doesn‚Äôt scare me. I took the vaccine so that if I did get sick it wouldn‚Äôt affect me as badly.  Problem is even if 100% of us are vaccinated, it still is not gonna be eradicated. I think it‚Äôs here to stay, like the flu.  I do Not believe that people should be forced to take a vaccine nor should they be ostracized, yelled at, and called names over choosing not to put this in their body.  I am sure you feel differently and that‚Äôs fine. I hold no hatred or animosity towards anyone. Life is too short to waste on those types of feelings it‚Äôs a waste of energy.
Not exactly super dark but there is a coworker who is taking advantage of the presence of covid and takes three day weekends ever since the state here has reopened in June (or July, can't remember). He doesn't show up every Monday. Guy literally makes up an excuse every week saying that his mom/dad/aunt/uncle/cousin/nephew is in the hospital. We all know it's bullshit. When this guy does show up to work he spends almost all day on the phone blowing off work and making his other colleague do everything. Who knows if he's actually on a phone call....but the boss knows this and is trying to fire him but can't (something about unemployment benefits) so he's trying to give him a hard time and cut his hours so he gets the message that he's no longer welcome here. This coworker used to complain to me about how the boss is trying to fire him for a dumb reason (stealing money) but I've known the boss longer than he has. Our boss isn't dumb. I'm sure there was something that he saw on camera or in the bookkeeping records that didn't sit right with him. I've believed his lies for a while until recently when I realized that this guy was manipulating others by playing the victim to get people to sympathize with him and let him get away with practically anything. As far as I know he is using all of his PTO and scrambling to get the very last drop of his unemployment benefits. He's the kind of person who barely comes to work then complains about not having money.   He told me that he is trying to sue the boss for discrimination and has filed multiple complaints but none of them go through. Sometimes when payday is a day late he keeps going on and on about calling the "union" and have the boss get in trouble (I think this is just BS cause he never does it, and employees are not allowed to part of a union here).   I get that covid has been an utter bitch to a lot of people out there but I think to use the pandemic to your advantage and intentionally avoid doing work and being productive, that is NOT OK. I wonder how many other people are out there doing this.
Wear a pretty outfit and dress up in something casual, it always makes me feel confident. When someone walks by, give a big welcoming smile and great them.
it is true though.
Fuck. I've been absolutely depressed and miserable for a few months now. Doing the bare minimum of living, eating like total garbage, with no motivation to do anything.  And now I feel super bad for my little microbes because I've been neglecting their home! They're probably miserable too because of me.   That might just be what I needed to try and kickstart a push through this mental rut I'm in.

If that‚Äôs how they feel about it, then that‚Äôs perfectly valid if it helps them deal with having been bullied. They‚Äôre here and the bully is not.  I‚Äôm just saying that I don‚Äôt think my bullys‚Äô deaths would undo the damage they‚Äôve done to me‚Äîwhich I still struggle with on a daily basis‚Äîso I‚Äôm just trying to understand the mentality‚Ä¶maybe more a vengeful mindset could be therapeutic for me‚Äînothing else has ever helped‚Äîbut then again, most of my bullies are living a lot better than me so I wouldn‚Äôt even have a point of reference from which to feel avenged.

That seems so bizarre to me.   I've always been introverted, but picked up social skills through school and early employment. Maybe it's a factor of my job requiring interpersonal communication (I'm both software developer and support specialist for said software), but my ability to socialize is mostly unaffected. Notably, I live with my girlfriend, and we've had friends over during the pandemic as long as they were within our trusted circle. I've visited family in-town, and gone out to dinner on rare occasion, open-air markets, so I kept some social interactions through the pandemic.  Is this social interaction loss a thing that's happening to people that managed to 100% isolate? I ask because at the very least I needed to go to the grocery store once in a while, and I've had long distance friendships for years so I e never felt truly isolated in any sense. I know self-assessment of social ability is flawed, but I haven't noticed any difference of interaction with the people around me.
It‚Äôs a pretty straightforward (and sad AF) case, so I also have trouble understanding this case. There wasn‚Äôt any weird twists or turns that would warrant a documentary imo

I'm a communication skills coach and isolation has led to a surge in clients seeking out help for their social and communication skills.  Extroverts contact me saying they've become introverts and introverts occasionally say they've become addicted to the loneliness. All of them say they are struggling to articulate their thoughts clearly.  A rare number of management figures have also realised that their social skills have diminished to the extent that they've lost their empathetic nature, causing them to become aggressive rather than understanding. Half of my job now is helping them re-learn how to be kind to the people they delegate responsibility to.
I never received something like that, but I wil tell you some of the best gifts that I gave, I knew that the girl liked crystals so I bought a amethyst and I passed 3 days learning how to make a necklace, the type of necklace that I did is "castroado", she loved it, I also made the present box with a lot of memes and references. I have a friend that she is an artist, so I pay her to make a funny art of me and the person, sometimes the pose is a reference or a meme.
ok?
My granddad died in covid, but I still have 2 grandparents and a step-grandma alive and I keep contact with them.

Over here most just take a cruise to Estonia to buy some duty-free alcohol to serve, since it's so much more expensive here. I've been to one wedding with a cash bar (minus a couple of glasses of champagne per guest on the bride and groom) though and I didn't really mind. It was actually quite nice, with unlimited free booze you run the risk of overdrinking, but if you gotta pay for it yourself you keep better track, lol.

Locking people down for over a year. Kids missing out on going on 2 years of a normal, in person education without being in prison like conditions.

Demonizing anyone who even dares to question vaccine mandates. Depression and suicide rates are skyrocketing. Social anxiety disorders as well. People looking at anyone they see as infectious.

Think of it this way...  The family got to enjoy some great times while cousin deteriorated. The price for not learning how to help your family members is occasionally very expensive.

Mine is:   You can catch a cold if you don't wear a coat in cold weather.   1) It takes coming into contact with a virus to catch a cold virus.   2) It is 100% false that being cold wears your immune system down. Your immune system only reacts to something that invades your body. Study after study has proved this.   3) Cold weather actually kills viruses. People get sick more in the winter time, because they are indoors more and in near contact with people who are infected.

I don't think any particular book got me into reading. It was more like an organic process of just learning to read and never stopping. Since I learned to read before I formed any lasting memories, I have no idea what I was reading but I'm sure it wouldn't be very interesting to me as an adult. However, the earliest book I can remember reading is *The House at Pooh Corner* by A. A. Milne at the age of four, but I almost certainly read *Winnie the Pooh* before that.  The last book I read was *A Midsummer Night's Dream* in *The Works of William Shakespeare, in Reduced Facsimile from the Famous First Folio Edition of 1623*. The last one I finished‚Äîif you count audiobooks‚Äîwas the Arkangel Shakespeare audiobook of *Romeo and Juliet*.  That's basically how I'm doing this reading project. First I read a chapter out of *Shakespeare After All* by Marjorie Garber as an introductory essay to the play, then I read the play out of the First Folio facsimile edition, then I get a sense of what it's like in performance with the audiobook, because it's recorded by professional actors affiliated with the Royal Shakespeare Company with music, sound effects, etc., making it the next best thing to seeing a live production of the play. So after I finish the audiobook of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*‚Äîand I've just been uploading the next several plays to my MP3 player‚ÄîI'll be ready to tackle *Richard II*.

Definitely. At the start we were all in it together, people were singing from balconies, clapping health workers, and then the snakes came and now we have new divisions, vax vs antivax, mask vs antimask, lockdown vs antilockdown, etc. And it's all been through lies, tricks and blurring of what those things are. For example, people who became hardcore antilockdown started framing their arguments as if they were talking about something indefinite and permanent, and not short term measures that flatten the curve, but that lift again.

My company won't let people stay home and work. And most of us can; there's literally no reason for most of us to physically be in the office. People rarely even print anything. But no, they want us to be there. I'm currently working from home because I'm genuinely scared of getting Covid again, but I don't think it's going to last long - my boss is going to be forced to make me come back. And I resent that because I'm pretty sure the place where I caught Covid last December was work. I wasn't going anywhere else.
Seriously. I was watching that show Dark and two teenagers had a sex scene where we saw both characters completely naked and then had to sit through two minutes of a close up on the guys but on top of her thrusting. Like what?! I could not believe it. I know Europeans are a bit looser about nudity and what not but seriously in what universe does anybody need to see two teens with one thrusting his cock into the other?! It was so excessive.

My grandfather. Unfortunately I had a pretty good relationship with him as a kid, which made things quite complicated for me when he passed. I found out pretty quickly that he was a narcissistic, abusive piece of shit, and I shouldn‚Äôt really be sorry that he died.  He raped my aunt multiple times when she was younger. I guess, like with all women in his life, he felt he had the right to treat her like a sex object.   He abused everyone. He would chase my father and his brother around with knives. Yes, you heard that right‚Äîhe would get drunk, grab a knife, and make his kids run away from him in fear of their lives as he tried to kill them. It would go on until he got exhausted. He hit all of his children and was abusive to my grandmother (who eventually got fed up with his shit and left him). He was emotionally manipulative and abusive as well, treated everyone around him like dirt.   He got all of his children started early on substance abuse. He gave them beer at like age 10. He would drive them out somewhere, get hammered, get them drunk, and then make them drive home as he blacked out.   He wound up having a stroke in the mid-2000s. Dude thought he wasn‚Äôt going to live long after it, so he gave up on all of his rehab. He wound up living for 10+ years like that until he died in 2017. You know who took care of him all that time? My aunt‚Äîthe very same one he sexually abused. We had a small get together at my father‚Äôs home with the immediate family, and that was about it. Even with all he did, I saw all of my father‚Äôs siblings cry that day. Clearly, it is complicated for them as well.   His actions have a lingering presence. My aunt and one of my uncles had sex with one another as teenagers. They‚Äôre still very flirtatious with one another when they see each other.   My uncle (same one as previous paragraph) is also an drug addict, abusive piece of shit. He killed animals as a kid because he thought it was fun. He has kids all over the country and made a business out of scamming people. I can‚Äôt tell you how many bullshit ventures he‚Äôs concocted‚Äîa recording studio, gambling machines, an entertainment agency, etc. They‚Äôve all eventually been outed as fake. He takes advantage of everyone around him, stealing their money, belongings, and playing with their emotions (like my poor grandmother). He beats and manipulates his kids, who he only sees every few years and tries to win them over with money and gifts. He forced them to act like they want to be around him when he‚Äôs in their presence. They‚Äôve all cut ties with him just recently. Not too long ago, he drove his car off of a walking bridge and crashed into a dam. When I heard it was him, I was hoping that he had left his seatbelt off and finally fucking dropped dead. Unfortunately, he just got a DUI and some major bruises. I look forward to the day he fucking drops. He‚Äôs somehow weaseled his way back into my grandmother and my aunt‚Äôs lives, turning them against my family for supporting his daughters (who came to us regarding the abuse). He‚Äôs like a fucking wasp that just hangs around and won‚Äôt stop being a cunt.

It‚Äôs not like guys are discriminated against a lot (i 100% believe overall women have it worse) but when it comes to kids we can sometimes be a little bit screwed over‚Ä¶ Most jobs I‚Äôve had have been working with children with either special needs or behavioral issues and I‚Äôll never forget working with one little girl who got really attached to me and loved sitting in my lap. Now believe me, I didn‚Äôt care if she did or didn‚Äôt, like it doesn‚Äôt matter to me but i was pulled aside and was told that male staff weren‚Äôt allowed to have children sit in their lap (assuming because only men are pedos?). Whats sad is initially i was told this little girl had a fear of men and large dogs since her parents were drug addicts and i was told she was initially taken away from them by police.
It's a bit reassuring that this isn't uncommon....but it's also really sad.

More people dying of cancer and other diseases.  In some cases, people aren‚Äôt getting face-to-face appointments with their GP‚Äôs quick enough, meaning their cancer is not picked up or treated in time.

>  You have the freedom to do as you please but by increasing the chance of accidents you're purposely infringing one of our natural rights, the right to life.  Then why allow people to drive at all? The chance of accidents increases when you go from 25 MPH to 30 MPH just as it does when you go from 70 to 75. Both of them involve risk-reward analysis. Now, me, I'd go full Autobahn and remove speed limits. If you're more risk-averse, you might want a 55 MPH limit everywhere. But we can discuss and compromise.
In response to the other comments here, you wouldn't have been a bad person if you held everyone to the same standards and people got what they worked for. I understand people have lives, but if I'm getting paid the same as someone and they're cutting out early, coming late, etc, I'm gonna be pissed. and I could know the whole story and I'd still be pissed. I'm not working more than someone because they have a hard life. I had it hard my whole childhood and I don't get a bonus for that.
A bunch of small businesses were forced to close last year while Wal-mart, Target, etc were allowed to stay open and grow market share, for no reason.  The risk of going to those places was probably greater than small businesses that could provide a product or service they could.  Rich got richer.

Speed determines distance traveled within reaction time and distance to stop. Roads with limited line of sight, many access points i.e. Intersections and driveways, or even wildlife crossings have a higher likelihood of requiring a driver to stop or rapidly change the direction of their car.   Speed limits absolutely prevent accidents.

The lockdown happened once in the u.s. it did nothing to contain the virus because it wasn‚Äôt long enough. The flip flopping of the trump administration and late response. Covid is still happening a year and a half later. People not getting vaccinated and wearing masks are the ones perpetuating this. I‚Äôm not arguing or wanting a big argument out of this but the lockdown isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs making everything a shit show!
We certainly new what was worth keeping, but there's a lot of 'moderate' value stuff that wasn't worth storing or move when we cleaned out my grandparents house. We were putting a lot of stuff out by the curb and actively rooting for it to get gone for someone who actually wanted it. Furniture and the like that doesn't have sentimental value would cost more than it's worth to hang onto.

Lost close friends and family members because they're full-blown conspiracy theorists. There is no arguing with them. They just bring it back to their opinions and crappy sources.  Science, people, science. You're entitled to your opinion, but not to your own facts. They exist whatever you think.  It hurts to see so many close ones thinking about themselves first and not caring about the well-being of others. Pride and narcissism.  It just hurts.
Can you guarantee that every conviction is correct? Isn't it much more likely that every justice system can make mistakes? Or that some groups of people (mentally disabled for example) would suffer disproportionately from that?

I mean, it is true that a lot of people are hesitant to return to work. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that parents can't be sure that their children will be in school or have childcare if the pandemic picks back up. Most of the people I know that dropped out of the workforce are women with school-age kids.

Anything out of print of course.  Funny story: I was bummed when the show Constantine was canceled.  This guy was selling a pirated DVD set on Ioffer (eBay wannabe), and I bought one right away because I figured it was my only opportunity.  He did a real professional job; the DVDs had colored labels and there was even a UPC code on the case.  What's funny is that an official dvd set actually did get released a couple years later and the case had the SAME artwork, John with a hand of flame.

If she thinks i stole something of hers or something and gets mad at me and finds it in her room she will come and apologize to me for assuming i did it or something. She also allows my sister and i to have tattoos and piercings, dye our hair as she had a couple in highschool and has a few tattoos as well and believes that if she‚Äôs had it or done it that it‚Äôs only fair that we can. She also is very trusting of us as her motto is she‚Äôll trust us unless we give her a reason not to. My stepdad is also the same way as they aren‚Äôt very harsh on grades either as they know some classes or teachers can be difficult but expects us atleast to pass and if not try our hardest and not half ass it through school and life. I failed my math class freshman year of college and was terrified to tell them and when i did they told me they weren‚Äôt mad as i stayed after school every day studying for the final. It had unlimited retakes of the final till the school closed and i stayed from open to close retaking it to pass but failed by 1 point. They just said what matters is that i tried my hardest and i didn‚Äôt slack so i‚Äôm beyond lucky of them for being very positive and not strict or harsh parents thankfully as i‚Äôve had friends meet them asking if my parents are looking to adopt or where they can get one of them.

Yes and for me it‚Äôs not a matter of belief.  What comes to belief is whether or not certain videos you watch are legit.  For instance the government navy videos look weird to me.  But some footage in the doc ‚ÄúClose Encounters of the Fifth Kind‚Äù is very compelling.  I think there‚Äôs multiple types of encounters.  One would be with beings who exist on the same physical reality plane as our bodies who literally travel here point A to point B to get here.  Harder to wrap my mind around due to the time constraints‚Ä¶ even if you were traveling at the speed of light the universe is too big to traverse very far without another method of travel.  Which may be possible.  Another type of encounter would be interdimensional visitors who project their consciousness into these vehicles and phase into into our reality, like tuning into a radio station, but that station is a set of coordinates in time.  These ‚Äúaliens‚Äù may travel in vehicles that are constructed at a higher dimension but suited to traversing multiple planes of reality.    I have had an experience where I had a lucid dream that I was in a Colosseum fighting waves of enemies, then became horrified to realize that none of the people I had dispatched had laid a finger on me.  I was just mindlessly killing based on fear.  It was a horrid realization.  Then when my consciousness snapped back to my bedroom I could see a small flying saucer (circumference of a 4-6 inches) hovering over my chest with streaks of blue lightning going between the bottom of the craft and my chest.  It slowly lifted away from me and changed opacity until it phased out of my perception.  My theory is that these were other dimensional beings testing my fear levels.    I had not previously conceived of a flying saucer being the size of a small plate but it makes perfect sense.  Size is so relative.  If they‚Äôre from another dimension full stop then maybe they are 10,000x ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù than us.  Had another experience where I was in dream having a not lucid dream‚Ä¶ pretty regular‚Ä¶ driving a car when I realized there was a spacecraft following me up above.  I tried to out run it, but as soon as it wanted, it grabbed me and snapped my consciousness immediately to another field.  And then I was with this large blue being, male.  And he said that they travel back to our time to set things right, basically.  He said some other things I forget.    To me both of these experiences were like ‚Äòalien abductions‚Äô but it was more like they were abducting my consciousness.    I‚Äôm sure some people will believe or not believe my experiences to be imaginary.  I would ask that people keep an open mind about who aliens are, where they come from, the way they work, and what their goals could be.  Because if the visitors are extra dimensional then we are talking about increasingly infinite possibilities.

My two girls fight over everything. Constantly. Like, they will both take shit from one another the moment they see the other one with anything. I've tried a lot of shit and the best I've figured out is "if yall can't figure out how to share your toys I'm taking it from both of yall". I usually got to take it and put it up. At least then it's fair. Generally, they will just move on like it didn't happen to begin with afterwards. I don't think they really want the toys, they just don't want the other one to have any. And they all belong to both of them for the most part so it's not like either of them have first dibs on any of the toys.

I switched schools in 3rd grade and there was a clique of girls that decided to single me out and be particularly mean to me. I didn't get invited to any birthday parties that year and this is when kids would come to sch with a stack of invitations to hand out in class. I came home crying one day about it and my dad said "why do you want to be friends with people who don't want to be friends with you?" It was the logic I needed to hear at that age and since then I've never invested my emotional energy into someone that isn't giving the same back. Definitely a healthy relationship lesson.

When I was little (in the early to mid 90s), I really wanted the Littlest Pet Shop Racing lizard. It was this little orange lizard in a plastic cube cage that looked like a mini desert scene. It changed colors when your hot little fingers touched it.   My dad was super poor in those days and couldn‚Äôt afford to buy it. When he finally got a better job, we went back to the store (I feel like it was a Walgreens or something) it was sold out. He would go back every weekend to this specific store and ask if they had it in stock yet. This went on for MONTHS. I was a little kid, so I had no idea how annoying this must have been to the people who worked there.   Anyway, his persistence paid off and one day they said they found one in a box in the back room! We couldn‚Äôt believe it. I still have it somewhere in a storage tub. I‚Äôll treasure it forever.

>All pedos want to 'touch' kids  That is in fact wrong. All pedophiles have an attraction to children, but that doesnt mean they want to 'touch' them. In reality most of them hate themselves for even thinking about it and would love to get rid of it. They suppress their feelings with all their might but without professional help this becomes a catalyst and leads to them actually doing it.   >You want sympathy for creeps who haven't had the opportunity yet... or just haven't been caught  I ask for sympathy for the children. They are the victims and they need to be protected and while you hate and judge people from the distance i actually try to solve the problem you are talking about. I try to make them come out of hiding ans get help, cause that is the only way to help them control themselves and to even know about them.  But then you guys come along and threaten them with death for something they cant change about themselves, and i ask myself why humanity still hasnt learned that blind hate doesnt work. Hating people for a feature (not a good one, but one that isnt their fault), has killed 6 million jews, suppressed black people for centuries and made disabled people outcasts of society for over 3000 years now.   Please understand that hate doesnt solve our problem it makes it worse.

Knowing when NOT to be one.
Oh I agree and as I was saying in another comment, I know how deep I was in, how emotionally fucked up I was. But had my brother come to me, with the relationship we had at the time, I believe it would have sunk on for me then to look at things differently.   But I can't change what happened so there is no use dwelling on that. The point I was making is that all of the people who came out of the woodwork even 3 and 4 years afterwards who told me all of the reasons *they knew* he was an awful person and that I was manipulated by him... all that did was make me feel pathetic and stupid and made me lose every ounce of self-respect and self-worth I had.

I (21M) dated a chick 10 years older than me for a while. I would advise against it.   Things can seem awesome, and they may be, but with an age gap like that, you‚Äôre both in very different stages of your life. I‚Äôm just starting off, while she has kind of already established her place in life.   You‚Äôre likely going to have very different goals. I.e. for me, I wanted to have myself a good career in 5 years, start a family after that. She was concerned she wouldn‚Äôt be able to at that time.   So while it can be a lot of fun, there‚Äôs gonna be some complications, and you can be perfectly compatible as people, but it will likely be more complicated and stressful than a relationship between 2 people at a closer age/ maturity level.   That‚Äôs my 2 cents, take it with a grain of salt.

Yes!!! This!!!   I learnt this after my ex husband over-flowed his sister‚Äôs toilet - we were visiting them in the US for the first time.

Cross platform play, choice of game servers, Driving, Battle royale, Battle passes, Protesting  *Cross Platform Play:* People on console facing off against $3k gaming computers that are running 200+ FPS constantly and have such good graphics they can spot you from miles  *Choice of Game Servers:* Giving people ability to play on other servers, instead of having a server for NA, SA, EU, RU, AS, etc etc, is that now you see memes of *‚ÄùWhen the guy with the enchanting table name joins your team‚Äù*, or when the Brazilians show up.

Driving exactly the speed limit, driving below the speed limit, blocking people from passing, intentionally going slow to piss people off, drunk driving, distracted driving, insurance fraud, speeding past stopped school buses, swerving through lanes, Not checking both ways, not checking blind spots. So many people do these things and cause accidents and pain for others. Makes driving a miserable experience.  *Battle Royale:* Used to be fun and enjoyable, used to be about managing resources and making sure to not get caught in the open, now it‚Äôs ‚Äúhaha crank 90s lolmaooo bad gg ez salty kid lol I did ur mom‚Äù  *Battle Passes:* Puts so many good features behind a pay wall, to increase profits for greedy corporations.

My great grandmother's husband passed years before her. Her house always felt creepy, well he was a trucker and would be home every weekend. And just like clock work every Friday at 6 pm you'd hear the front porch creak, then after about 8 seconds you'd hear heavy boot steps on the kitchen floor. She started deteriorating on a Monday, she wanted to be home so the hospital let her go home, there was nothing they could do. She passed at 6:05 that Friday, her last words were to her daughter, "Don't cry, George is here to walk with me. The next Friday there were not boot steps, the house has now fallen silent with time. After she passed the house felt happier. Now I'm not a very spiritual person but I believe her husband waited for her

I can't understand this mentality. You're a tourist in the land too. We the people own our national parks. They have all the same right to it as you do.   It sounds like you're saying that you use it right but they use it wrong.... Or that you deserve it because you found it first.

When I got the replacement packs I refused to let anyone else use them, and I still have them now at 25. All in perfect condition.  I also lost pencils, writing pens, sharpeners and rubbers (erasers) just by letting someone borrow it in a lesson and they'd either keep it or give it to someone else.

To 'turn the other cheek' to your bullies. Instead teach them to know when to stand up against certain people so that they aren't a doormat in certain situations. Standing up for yourself ofcourse doesn't apply everywhere since some situations ask for you to "be the bigger person" and walk away to avoid conflicts. However, i think sometimes people need a good whack because it's never okay to let someone cross your boundaries. Confidence and self efficacy is just a bonus perk along the way.

The best way I can explain this to people in their 30s is imagine what you were like when you were 19.  I was a university student who drank and played video games on the weekends when I wasn't stressed with studies and what the fuck I was going to do after graduation.  Compare this to my 30s where things just kind of weirdly made sense with my career now really taking off where I now have my own car, my own place plus have to now think of finances instead of how to beat Rock Band 2's endless playlist.  I don't think I can relate to a 19 year old now, that's all.  Hence the "mind gap".
Long story but...I was at walmart and I saw this license plate that said "IM2A2BD" and I was like what the heck so I, being the weird person I am with no boundaries, left a note on their windshield with my number and asked them to explain. The next morning I woke up to a text that said "I am too alive to be dead. I used to have cancer and now I'm cancer free. Have a great day!" And I just thought it was the coolest thing ever and it reminded me that sometimes we take life for granted. There are people out there who don't get much of a chance at life but the rest of us? We live more of a life than anyone and we don't even care. I wish I appreciated life as much as this dude. Like he/she could've died from cancer a while back but here they are sitting here loving life and telling ME to have a great day. I don't even know this persons name but they made my day. And kinda opened my eyes. Since then, I've tried living my life in such a way where I am just too damn alive to be dead.

This poor, lovely man was frail and afraid and in so much pain, and she tortured him in his last years. She did this because she wanted his house, and she wanted his money when he died.  One day when we were visiting him in the hospital, days before he passed, and that's when the abuse came to light. At one point during our visit, he had a minor argument with the bitch, and she stomped out of the room. He looked visibly afraid of her, and cried at one point. I was too young to notice or remember any of this, but it must have been heartbreaking for my mum and my older sisters seeing this man in that state. I remember him being funny and warm and kind, and all my sisters see him in the same light, but amplified 100x. I never really knew him, but he's remembered as such a good soul.  Afaik, she never got the money she wanted. She also never got the house. That went to my parents.  As far as I'm aware, my mum and one of her sisters is still in contact with the psychotic bitch. The youngest was a daddy's girl and she fell into a severe depressive episode when her father passed. I think she was the only good daughter of the bunch. His death hit her hard.

Virtue Signaling has always been part of marketing, it is literally what marketing means. A cigarette ad from 70 years ago shows you how healthy their cigarettes are and that doctors recommend them, thats already signaling the virtue that not only the cigarettes are healthy, but that you, as a consumer of said brand, are someone who cares about health, which you show by obviously chosing them as your cigarette brand, signaling to everybody else your virtue of healthiness.
A couple years ago, I used to live out in the middle of nowhere. At the time I also had a coworker who was an older gentleman and really loved movies. We would chat about them and swap recommendations. He told me that he would drive an hour to the closest GEO on the weekends to rent DVDs and return his old ones. I recommended that he look into Netflix and Amazon Prime Video because he could watch whatever he wanted during the week and save time and gas money. He told me he couldn't do it because he didn't have a computer at home, didn't have a smartphone and didn't even have an internet connection at home. The only time he used the internet was at work.   Obviously there is a generational aspect to this and I feel like people my age and younger use streaming about as much as they do back in the US.  But I have always gotten the impression that the older generations here have been pretty slow to adopt technology compared to the US. I don't think that they're in immediate threat of closing down.  But at least when this new generation of ipad kids become adults, these places are going to struggle to get them to start paying for their service.

Oh my god people love doing this, friends and family. You start making some horrible out of character mistake, like getting into a toxic relationship or developing an addiction or whatever, and everyone‚Äôs like ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt change, we‚Äôre CUTTING YOU OFF‚Äù and they pat themselves on the back for being ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù or whatever.   Everyone abandoned me when I got severely depressed and couldn‚Äôt function. It was rarely explicitly (not never) stated, but I was labeled as ‚Äúlazy.‚Äù I was the most sick, physically and mentally, I have ever been in my life. Everyone bailed and treated me like I was being an asshole, especially because I turned to booze at times and had a tendency to drink myself into oblivion whenever I got too close to actually just shooting myself. But just being sad and not showering or eating and isolating myself was enough for my family and the majority of my friends to label me as‚Ä¶ some sort of bitch?   Like I was so, so, so lonely and sick, and everyone acted like I was terrible for feeling this way. I internalized that nobody cared about me and they seemed to want me to suffer.   Years later I broke my arm, the dumbest, most trivial injury, and suddenly everyone was there for me, and acting like mother fucking Theresa with their generosity. It was my left, non dominant arm, a sliver of the pain and compromise I had experienced with depression.   This entire experience changed me. It‚Äôs been about 5 years, but I‚Äôm pretty positive I‚Äôll never forget. I just can‚Äôt see people the same way I used to. And now it‚Äôs like my oxytocin receptors or whatever are fried. I just can‚Äôt gain new genuine connections with people because I trust no one anymore.

There is a company that owns several hospitals in my area. They used to feed us (the ambulance crews) for free when we were on shift. You could eat at the cafeteria of take a sandwich to go or whatever. It was decent food, and hey, you're saving money right?       Well one guy started coming in with his uniform on when he was off work and grabbing sandwiches and chips and drinks, you name it. Lots of it. Basically grocery shopping in the hospital cafeteria and taking it home with him. Needless to say the hospital decided it wasn't going to supply us with food for our off days so they stopped it altogether.       I'll never understand why people will ruin a good thing.

It is actually possible (common, even) and 100% valid to have very mild cases of OCD, and they aren't hard to self-diagnose. Just because somebody doesn't take medication or hasn't been diagnosed, doesn't mean they don't have it.
I don't see really the point why not.   If people are in love age doesn't matter when you're adult. If there is a mind gap and both sides have different thinking it will be a hard relationship but there's not always a mind gap. It's hard to explain for me because I'm not that good at English but basically sometimes people at the age of 19 can be more mature than older people and can have the mind of a 30 year old.   Basically if it's true love there should be nothing stopping them.

I agree. My parents are good friends with a couple with a 20 yr age difference and they‚Äôve been married for over 20 yrs and still going strong. They got married when the guy was 50 and the woman was 30. It is a pretty large gap, but they were both old and mature enough to be able to maintain a healthy relationship. I really doubt their relationship would‚Äôve worked out if they got together when he had been 40 and she was 20.

I guess I'd be on the unpopular side, but aside from nostalgia, isn't it better some of the internet dies if the content creators don't want it active? It makes them no money and also helps scrub stuff like revenge porn. It's always been ra ra the Internet is forever don't put anything out you don't want seen. I didn't think I'd cheer some of it scrubbing away, much like most of us. But in general if we wanted it to stay, we'd host it. Think of the countless weird shit you did in the my Space/MSN/AIM era. Sometimes stuff is just not worth preserving.
That's a bit like flexing a car that you rented on borrowed money for the weekend.

I can't say if he has the same job but I do know an FBI agent who works in the sex crimes division. He's one of the few people willing to handle child porn cases because sometimes they have to watch violent videos of children being raped or tortured. Average person last under 30 days. He's done it for the last 15 years.   The perks are really good though. He unofficially gets unlimited time off for mental health days and unlimited counseling for life. As long as he checks in with his boss a couple times a day and answers some basic questions he can just wake up and decide to no go to work that day, or even in one case that week. The only thing is if he takes more than a day off they'll start doing welfare checks multiple times a day.   He absolutely hates his job but sees it as his civic duty to save children.

I am not a bad person, but I think like one. The first iteration of any plan I have is wholly self serving. I hate charity work and feel like I unintentionally manipulate people in to doing what I want. It's a sort of cognitive dissonance where my actions are very kind, I try my best to ensure that, but my thoughts tend to be very amoral and insensitive towards others.

I'm honestly not trying to put you on the spot, you said you don't believe in the flat Earth and I honestly take that at face value. But you are seeming claiming that you can't trust scientists who publish findings that the earth is a globe because people who finance them have an agenda. Let's assume most if not all scientists are just in it for a buck. Who stands to gain from pushing the narrative that the earth is a globe over a disk.    What I'm saying has more to do with the specifics of globe over disk. Not weather you can trust scientists or not in general.  I'm really just curious about why anyone would do that.

You're a liar and this is exactly what I'm talking about. It says by the slaves from the heathen around you. Indentured servitude is wrong too but that isn't what this is. You can pass these people on to your children as property. You can beat them.  You are so warped and this is a perfect example of why it needs to go. A grown arse man defending assault and slavery. Go and fully fuck yourself.
For most cases, it sounds like a fucking terrible idea.   On one hand we got someone who has potentially just left their home for the first time to study and try this freedom of living on your own. They're about to discover that toilet paper costs money and cleaning takes a lot more than just five minutes if you wish to keep your flat presentable. Do I like to party? Have I been able to even express my fashion sense and find my style while living at home? What are my actual interests now that I'm out of the highschool clique and popularity based system and into the world where you as a personality are a bigger factor in how popular you are, rather than who you hang out with?  On the other, someone who potentially has done all that shit and has figured out a groove that they'll likely stay for the rest of their lives. Jobs possibly turned into a career. House? Bought on a loan. Finances? Everything is on auto-payment. Every Friday is chicken-wing night, laundry done on Thursday for the week.  A 19 year old might not have anything figured out in their lives. It's a safer bet than that they do. For a 30 year old, the opposite is true. After two years the then-19-year-old might be a completely different person, whereas the 30 year old is likely to change very little, at least in comparison.  I don't really care about the age-gap as such - Wife being 10 years older than me after all. It's the age of the younger person in the relationship. Rarely does anyone over 30 see 20-year-olds as nothing more than fucking kids anymore. Most - if not all - people thinking back to their twenties just see a fucking idiot, fumbling around. Someone they'd love to smack some sense into.   Not someone they'd see as a date.

I have bones that don't want to break. That seems nice, but bones heal in 3 to 6 months fairly easily. Destroying tendons is a surgery with arthritis in 20 years.   I fell massively and while my bones didn't break, my ACL did and my MCL was massively torn and my LCL was pulled. A break would have been 3 to 6 months. Now, I am expected to have arthritis in my knee by the time I am 40.

I'm with you on this. I just don't care to make a fuck ton more money. I don't think I'd even be comfortable with a salary of $200,000 a year. I'd probably just stash 2/3s of it away.

It depends on what your skills are (or can be, if you're willing to work at it/practice) and what you consider to be "a lot of money."  Programmers and other tech fields make "a lot of money" (in the $100k range), but their bosses make *more* money. Do you have the skills to be a manager-type though?  The best "money" comes from starting your own successful business and then getting bought out by a bigger competitor, again like all those tech companies.  Or be a pro athlete and get paid millions!  Again, it depends mostly on your skills. What are you good at? And how can you get paid to do it?

Worst hell of it is phantom pain from what is going on. It's so real to you, when you do manage to wake up and get your slippers on, you're still feeling the hurt of it and that state of mind is absolute terror as you hoped it was a part of the dream/ that is would end yet it is still happening.   Usually stops within a minute of being UP and AWAKE, but having the fat under your skin ijggle like it is being electrocuted and your internal organs feeling "melted" all night long in the freaky part of it is not so nice, but having it still happen up being out of bed is just one scary cherry on top.

The QR code system as we know it has been around for about a decade, but the technology has existed since the 90s. Back then it was almost exclusively used by warehouses and factories. So they'd typically be much less complex and use larger squares because you only had to encode the relatively small amounts of data your company needed to keep track of things. It's only when you had people all of a sudden start using them over the internet, and almost anyone being able to access them with ubiquitous cellphone usage  that they had to get as complex as we see today with the tiny squares.

Yeah, this is the main reason why I'm questioning a lot of posts in this thread. We've got a really beautiful state park near us. There is a "tourist center" that is always packed to the absolute brim. And the attractions immediately attached to it have literal lines, like waiting at Disneyland.   But 1 mile on the trail and it is very normal to have a full hike without seeing another individual.   I feel like people in this thread drive up to the tourist hubs, take one look, mumble to themselves "look at all these goddamn instagram california tourists", then get back in their car and drive back to their hotel room.

556 is perfectly capable for 99 percent of when small arms is needed. Most people can't shoot past 500 yards consistently anyway, and inside of that 556 performs quite well. You're conflating size with damage which isn't necessarily the case with bullets. A .45 is much bigger than a 556 round but moves at less than 1/3rd the speed, meaning getting hit with the 556 leads to substantially more energy being transferred to the target. Especially since 762 tends to result in through and through wounds, leaving whatever energy is left to exit the body with the bullet. Ask anyone who has been shot by 556 from a 16 to 20 inch barrel. It's not something you just walk off. Plus with lighter, smaller ammo you can carry more rounds.

A slightly more lighthearted example to lighten up this reply thread a little:  When I was a very little kid, I started saying that I had seen a "big basher." My mom eventually got from context and tone that I was talking about privates, but had no idea where I could have learned that term or where I had seen them. She was terrified trying to figure out if I had been molested at daycare or something. Eventually my mom asked me to draw what I'd seen. Kid me drew... a wrecking ball with spikes.  Turns out I had just accidentally glimpsed my dad changing his pants one day. I didn't get a good look since it was just an accidental glimpse, and what I thought I saw didn't exactly line up with the reality. Not knowing the term penis, I invented a term that seemed to fit what I'd seen.   All that stress could have probably been avoided if I'd just been taught the proper name and what that was.

Got many frozen dinners and it showed just the brand, made it a pain the ass to keep track of everything I scanned. I had to clear the cart twice in order to get the right counts.

I don't mind if someone needs to go at my place, but as an adult you really shouldn't often run into a poop emergency.  I haven't had to poop at a friend's house, my parents house, my sister's house, or a brick and mortar store in several years. I'm not bragging, just saying I believe I have a relatively normal poop cycle and it hasn't been necessary in a while.  If you find the need to regularly poop in toilets that aren't yours you might have an underlying issue. The need to poop is rarely an emergency unless you have a poor diet, underlying food allergies, or some sort of irritable bowel issue.  There is nothing wrong with it. Just if you gotta poop just a bit just....wait. And if emergency like situations come up with any regularity it might be worth taking a look at.  People don't like it when other people poop in their toilet, as a general rule. Especially in an apartment with a single toilet - your toilet. That's not weird at all man.

Maybe some different perspective, and something rarely talked about: victims of sexual assault will sometimes develop the whole r*pe role play kink, which to a lot of people, sounds fucked up and counterintuitive, right? But it‚Äôs actually quite simple: it‚Äôs almost a therapeutic way of having a do-over of the event but within the parameters of having control over the situation.  It‚Äôs something I dealt with and looottts of therapy helped. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm really into it anymore but for a hot second, it was helpful in a weird, fucked up way.

Basically; I work at a restaurant (Host, Kitchen Expo, and food running) on Saturday I had this couple who came in who I sat in one of my close friends who is a server‚Äôs section. When I sat them down they asked me ‚ÄúIf you could have one thing right now; what would it be‚Äù I took a moment to answer and said I would want my sister to grow up better then I did and do more of what she wants to do. (Me: M, 18, Catholic family) and they spoke with me for a few minutes on how I related to the role of a Shepard from the Bible, in John 10. Now I‚Äôm not religious I don‚Äôt really have a set belief. I‚Äôm not an atheist, but I‚Äôm not sure what to believe. So they asked me to go home and read John 10. So I did. The husband came in this morning and gave me an envelope and told me do not open this until you get home. On the envelope it states ‚ÄúLove Offering‚Äù with their names, phone number, an address (.3 miles from my house), and a date and time. When I got home after my double shift I opened it and there is cash inside. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Im not religious nor do I intend to start studying the Bible I have enough on my plate as it is. I feel like I can‚Äôt take this I did nothing to deserve it other then have a conversation with some very nice people and exchange stories. I‚Äôm in shock. I need advice on what to do, and need help understanding what a ‚Äúlove offering‚Äù is.

All jokes aside, I am a former gang member (technically not former, just fell back from that life years ago). I‚Äôve told the story of how I got shot a few times on this site. The reality of how it feels to be a ‚Äúgangster‚Äù is nothing like the glamour and bullshit you see in movies and tv. The reality is, you spend almost every moment on high alert, and it‚Äôs stressful af. I could be chillin on the block with a bunch of my bros, but I‚Äôm watching every car, looking at every person no matter how far they are, paying attention to everything. Even when I was in my home, I‚Äôm making sure the lights are off in rooms I‚Äôm not in, and when I am in those rooms I am dimming the lights. Never playing music or the tv too loud because I want to make sure I am hearing everything. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt even leave out the front door because I didn‚Äôt want the wrong person to drive by and see where I live. I‚Äôd go out the back and jump a fence into the neighbors yard, and walk out that way. When driving Id always make sure to never hit a red light or be stuck at a stop sign too long. I could never go out with my mother or sisters in public. Things like that. Not to mention the really bad days where you get calls in the middle of the night that your homie just got hit, or wake up the next day and see one of your people‚Äôs got raided.  Being a ‚Äúgangster‚Äù is one the most stressful things you can choose to be. 0/10 wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.

I, that is to say ‚Äúwe‚Äù, reincarnate into each other. The connective fiber between all of us is this unshakable sense of centrality. From my perspective, it‚Äôs this being‚Äôs turn to see the many forms and shapes of God-as-verb. When this form dies, ‚Äúmy‚Äù memories go with them and this sense of awareness relocates to another place and time, to another person.  It‚Äôs spiritual hooey, but it‚Äôs made it easier to be kinder to people. Only God knows what they‚Äôre going through.

Because there's nothing beyond God.   Picture this. We used to think the earth was flat and the sun revolved around us. God created the world like this. Ok.  But then we discovered the earth was round. Sun still revolves around us. Ok, we had it wrong. God created round earth apparently.  But wait a minute, turns out Earth revolves around the Sun. So THAT'S the world God created.  Big Bang? God created.  No more Big Bang, we just discovered that the whole universe I'm fact came from inside of a rabbit's anus. No problem, God created the rabbit.  I don't need to ever disprove nothing. Whatever is the new truth, God made it.  I believe that the Universe was created by God, and whatever Universe no matter what can still be God's creation  And as a side note, all of our Universe came from on single point. One single source. I mean... C'mon guys. It's so beautiful.

That's a pretty shitty family.   My colleagues and manager are a pretty tight knit group too.

Simple problem, simple solution.

> and remember, peeing after sex reduces the chances of getting a UTI!  So many people don't know that. It was never mentioned in sex education or by my gynecologist. Fortunately my mom was cool enough to tell me that at age 16.

This happened in Netherlands so me and my family is just walking when i felt like peeing my dad and me started walking around to find a bathroom so minutes after that were still walking when i really cant hold it in anymore so i told my dad that i really need to pee so my dad spoke to a random man and he took us at a brothel i thought that its weird but i have no choice.

All right, you do mean wedding then. I think non religious people choose a religious wedding because the non religious option is just no so great... In Belgium, a non religious wedding is a very short ceremony officiated by a politician in a pretty generic room. On the other hand, a religious wedding means a much longer ceremony, in centuries old church often with music and speeches by family and friend. it's just a different atmosphere.   The other reason I can think of is family "pressure". Even if the couple is not religious, there is a "pressure", sometimes just implied, that the wedding will be religious.
When they talk about girls. One day I was talking to a girl on the phone and my mother went into my room. Then I told her I was talking to a girl. When I went to the kitchen to get dinner, my mother was very intrusive and really try to get information about that girl. I was feeling so embarrassed that I told my mom ¬´¬†you should not be talking to me this was¬†¬ª before leaving the table.

Amway. People just need to stop it. Been around way too long
The day I got my dog. I've wanted a border collie my whole life, I love them. I went to the SPCA, "just to look". And they showed me this 2yr old little baby that had been returned three times already. She immediately hugged me so she was the one I chose. She had heart worms, they didn't know if she was house trained, she was terrified of everything, they believed she was severely abused- but having been abandoned myself it almost felt like the universe sent my dog to me.   Her heartworms are gone, she plays with my cat and loves walks and affection from anyone. She's not afraid anymore. And Im really happy I walked in to the SPCA that day

Yes mixing gets it pretty close. I used to ask specifically for paulaner spezi. I wasn't a big fan of Mezzomix. It got the job done but not my preference when craving a spezi.   Then again I could have also gotten a beer for the same price. It's shocking how cheap beer is there compared to a soda. The sodas aren't even free refill. I was very annoyed the first time I stepped into a basic restaurant and ordered a soda and got a single can for something like 3.40 euros while a beer of high quality German beer was 3.80 euros. And then it didn't even come with free refills! With that said after enough time I didn't crave that much soda anyway. Our sodas in the states are grossly oversized. Fortunately I have now a taste for basic soda water (water with gas). Which ironically is 9/10 times free in most American restaurants with free refills... Lol
Hey. Life is too short. Shoot your shot. If you want to be more than friends, it‚Äôs not going to matter about losing them as an actual friend.  You want more. Go for it. There are more people to be friends with if it doesn‚Äôt work out. The potential gain Is greater than the loss. If it doesn‚Äôt work out put it behind you.

>im not particularly fussed in gatekeeping what is and isn't a sport  It's kind of silly, isn't it? Whether or not something is a "sport" is a question with no substance whatsoever. It's pure semantics. The actual question isn't what is and what is not a sport; the actual question is what arbitrary definition do you ascribe to the word "sport."  Under one definition, this or that activity is a sport. Under another definition, it isn't. So what've we accomplished? Since there's no inherent significance or value as to whether an activity is a sport or not, all you've done is put together an arbitrary box and arbitrarily decided what does and doesn't go into it.

I don‚Äôt think you can ‚Äònot worry‚Äô about the future of your friendship. It‚Äôs just as likely there won‚Äôt be one as there will. Overcoming fear happens when you do whatever it is despite your fear. You ‚Äújust do it anyway‚Äù. It helps to think about the drawbacks of not doing it. It doesn‚Äôt help to think about the drawbacks of doing it. We all know we don‚Äôt get anywhere without trying, except for things like breathing which we do subconsciously. We may not practice being mindful of every little effort we make, like getting out of bed, brushing our teeth, etc etc. But if you take the time to be mindful you may see how you manage to overcome many concerns. As you confront your fears you may find they lessen all the time. I think it‚Äôs more troubling that we can‚Äôt just drop those feelings of attraction etc when the subject doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I wish there was an off switch for those feelings in those situations.

Well, I can start by looking at the world where we live, if there is a god, why is there so much misery and sadness, poverty, etc? The big master plan does not convince me. Also, there is no real evidence of miracles, interventions or any other thing that supports the god hypothesis. No book is evidence, no spoken stories are evidence. Faith is just a religious word for hope, we all have hope about something. Also, imaginary friends are good if you are up to 6/7 years old, I'm not saying people should not believe what they want, but we must challenge our "believes" as we grow older, it's imperative to change perspectives. The same applies to atheist, for sure. But when I tried to just imagine that a god made all this and I started to realize how the world works, there was no way I could agree that there is a god, and an interventionist one. If science lifted so much ignorance on our collective knowledge, why to still insist that god does that science can't explain? In time there will be no more gaps for this idea to hold on to.

Apollyon basically means "we can't contain it and it will destroy the world, there's basically nothing we can do"  It started with a single entry that was honestly really cool. It has a bunch of hidden stuff and it acts like you need security clearance to view more. Eventually the article reveals at the highest level of clearance that its keter designation and the ritual documented in its containment procedures are all horse shit for morale and the foundation knows it cannot defeat the entity.   But that was years ago so I'm sure there's been more at this point.

Attending college classes in pajamas (and in bed). Or really just doing anything else during lecture (eating, cleaning, etc.)
Please allow me to introduce myself....
Dropped acid once in college (the one and only thing I've ever tried) during summer classes.   I didn't feel a thing for roughly an hour then had to use the restroom and the linoleum floor started shifting and then I spent what felt like another hour looking in the mirror into my own eye.  From there we left the house and went to a party and my cheeks hurt so bad from the constant smiling yet felt an incredible amount of paranoia that it was obvious what I was on.    Everything was fine and weird but the one thing I didn't know was that there was no way I was going to be able to sleep that night.  So after the party we went back to the house we rented and ended up playing badminton in complete darkness due to the eye dialation.   Lots of little weird things but nothing life altering or crazy visions.

And also threatened to come to my house, murder me and then kill himself over my body so we‚Äôd be together in death.   He was my first boyfriend, seemed completely normal when we were dating (a little immature but normal). I‚Äôd planned on staying friends with him after I broke up with him until he literally went crazy.

Everyone should make an effort to please their partner but there is no time frame of how long men should last. It's totally natural to not last long, just make an effort to please your partner and they will appreciate it.   My long term partner is often self-conscious about how long he "lasts" but he puts in effort and makes me feel loved and wonderful. If I need more I can do it myself.
>Not sure how accurate any of that is but its what I got from it.  None of it is accurate.

Doesn't matter how rough it is, they don't deserve any sympathy (or empathy) from me. I don't care about what my mom and dad went through because in the end they fucked up my life. That's evil. Their childhood doesn't matter. Them being abused themselves doesn't matter. They chose to have me, and chose to fuck everything up. Their pain doesn't make them somehow "less bad". He was a grown ass adult, he was not the crying child being abused by his mother anymore, and she was a grown ass woman, she was not the sad little girl being mistreated anymore. They had the choice to fix their shit, they didn't. That's their own fault. They knew exactly what they were doing. Fuck both of them.
Anywhere that does not all restaurants to cook their burgers any less than well done.
Drug addicts. Especially when they die from OD
Years ago (don't even remember how many) I took a boat trip to Murano and visited a glass blowing shop that had tours. It was mesmerizing to watch their work and later having a chat, one of the artists commented on how he could not compete with the prizes of Chinese knock offs and that most tourists didn't even care where their bauble came from, as long as they bought it in Venice so they could show it off later. It was very sad. The little vase I bought from him is one of my most treasured possessions. It's beautifully crafted and has many good memories associated with it.
God, i wish i was invisible. Just fucking disappear and spend the rest of my life as a phantom. Then, if i ever want to reappear, I'd put on a top hat and monocle and become like a celebrity or some shit. Hollywood loves freaks.

I've found at least one good thing and I'm sure you'll find another tomorrow and the next day after and then the next and we'll slowly climb ourselves out of this sinkhole. And life will be better.

Idk man, I pooped in the woods a couple times, and it always seemed like there would be some big ass flies (no pun intended) flying around around your ass. I hated the feeling that they were gonna land on my butthole. Big fuckers too. Like you could hear their loud buzzing, right by your butt, and just waiting for them to land on you and bite you. I hate pooping in the woods.

Sapio has to do with wisdom/intelligence. Think Homo sapiens (humans) means wise (sapiens) man (Homo).  People also often talk about being sapiosexual. Meaning they get turned in by intellegence. Which I believe is what is being referred to here.

I dunno about ‚Äúknow‚Äù but  I think it‚Äôs possible, even likely that this is a simulation. Something fabricated by an artificial intelligence so advanced that it breaks the line between what‚Äôs real and virtual. In a previous timeline, we didn‚Äôt make it to the stars, so we create something that can make a whole new, inner world. A machine-dream of dilated time that we used to run away from absolute destruction. And we‚Äôre about to do it again. An ever-unfolding, amaranthine dream of light running away from its own shadow, playing hard-to-get with a duality that never existed.  But the mind makes it real, and that makes everything a little less cosmically lonely.

Overhyped.  Is it better than regular sex? For some people, Yes. Is it in another league of satisfaction for the male? No.
Currently, in the U.S., we do not have free speech. There have been thousands of lawsuits dealing with the first amendment that have narrowed down what speech is permitted, and what is not. I don't believe hate speech should be protected. Those protections are there to save lives, and protect people.  And I'm sorry, but I can speak very personally that one's racial identity can factor highly in their individual identity, whether they like it or not. And it's only because of those who continue to treat people differently because of their nationality, or color of their skin that the entire thing is an issue. There is no reason why a person's racial identity SHOULD influence their individual identity, but the fact of the matter is that it does, unfortunately, have an influence.
Painful.

My friends and I were playing cod together and talking about regrets we had. One of my friends said he killed a guy, and the tone of his voice sounded gleefully secretive. Before I realized he was talking about the video game, I felt grosser than ever.
candy. Only my favourites thanks.
I've been told that I "Suck the fun out of life." before which is kinda similar.  After I seriously questioning him about it, analyzed the statement, and then questioned him a few more times, it turned out what he was referring to was my ability to nitpick the flaws out of anything.  But in truth, I like fun things. I just also like to know if the fun thing will break at random, and if you show me a fun thing and I notice a way it can break easily, I'll warn *you* so you get to keep it for longer.  It turns out some people confuse risk analysis with pessimism. Who knew? So as long as whenever he showed me something he thought was fun, and I realized was terribly flawed, I smiled and spared myself the waste time of explaining, he remained happy. Right up until it broke. Then he said things like "Whoa, who knew it could do that? Man that sucks."  Meanwhile, I'm ten feet away biting back the biggest I-wanted-to-tell-you-so.

Why where you at a gay bar?
Money. Having enough money so you don't need to worry about housing etc, and being able to cut back the number of hours needed to work would massivley help ease the pressures of life.
Happened to me. I just said no and told him i am not gay. Since then he has followed me on all social media switched schools and started at my school, he always stares at me and makes little hearts with his hands and points at me and wont leave me alone.
Really any kind of Protestant evangelism. You don‚Äôt need any real credentials, just a group of buds that agree you fit into their club and a not-for-profit enterprise backing you.
Well, i bet your saunas aint at 85-100c below that we call them just hotrooms or what ever. But yes it need temprature and very poor air circulation and lot of people in a small space with chlorine water soaked skin and swinsuits. Milder symptoms would be tickling/"bite?" eyes and rash on your skin, something ive experienced. But atleast in Finland saunas you are required to take a shower before going to sauna from pools.

Zeppelin wasn't a new band. I mean, they were new, but not really....  They were built from The Yardbirds, which was-- for a hot minute-- one of the most highly respected electric blues bands in Britain. In America they were not as popular, but still would have been known to everyone in the industry, as well as any guy who picked up a guitar.   As The Yardbirds splintered, Jimmy Page ended up with the rights to use the name. He bought in Page and Plant, who were just making a name for themselves in Britain, and John Paul Jones, who already had a solid reputation in the industry. They were going to be "The New Yardbirds", playing the Yardbirds catalog. The first album has a bunch of material Page was saving for the next Yardbirds album, like "Dazed and Confused".  The band name was changed in the 11th hour. In spite of the name change, everybody who was anybody in the music industry ran out to get the album as soon as it dropped.   I can't think of what the equivalent would be today. I guess, The Foo Fighters? You have one known star bringing in up-and-comings, and all the Nirvana fans ran out to but the album.

One of my friends got his steam account hacked.  Someone from a common server sent him a dm on discord apologizing for reporting his steal account by accident and that he needed to talk to someone else to prevent his account from getting banned.  My friend DM'd the second guy and got sent a link to log in on steam and all, which should've been a red flag but he still did it.   At this point he called me to help him because it was taking some time and the first thing I said when he told everything to me was "bro you really fell for that ? That's a scam, if you logged in your account is dead"   Then soon after how account was fully locked but I helped him making an account recovery demand and he got it back 2 days after.

I'm Australian and live in Australia and have travelled overseas a lot.   Pros: culture is laid back and leisurely (work to live culture), pharmaceuticals are cheap, affordable healthcare, food is top notch, massive coffee culture, wildlife is cool, beaches are amazing, weather is good (well depends where you are but anywhere below Brisbane is good), high wages, good employment benefits (4 weeks annual leave, sick leave, long service, maternity/paternity), it's extremely safe, multicultural, people are generally friendly, life is pretty easy here.  Cons: tech advancements take more time to arrive here, it's a conservative place so things like marijuana legalisation won't happen for a really long time, lots of rules and bureaucracy, property prices are insane (especially in Sydney and Melbourne), it's a long way from anywhere (well except SE Asia), alcohol and cigarettes are very expensive (except I'd say wine is very affordable), no real constitutional rights (freedom of assembly, speech etc).   Hope this helps!

I left two years ago. My salary was $27,000 a year. I went from one beat (health) to 13 by the time I quit. I couldn't keep up. I used to do 3-5 enterprise pieces per year in addition to my regular work. Since I left, the paper hasn't done a single 2-3 part story, there's no investigative reporting anymore (a colleague quit the week before I did and was one of the best I've seen).   It's all just churn out shit to fill space now. One of the main features on the website is "check out houses for sale in town." They have a special Covid section, but the majority of it is press releases and stories from around the state. They haven't done a single story that wasn't built off a press release during the entire pandemic.  The editor who hired me wrote an editorial every single day, for 17 years. The editor there writes a column from time to time (one every six weeks or so) and always finds a way to get Jesus in it.   I honestly only read the paper when someone points me to it now. It's full of garbage and fluff.   I left for many reasons, including only making $14 an hour after nearly six years, the constant push to do overtime off the clock, the regular tantrums of a 56-year old editor, and the new rules, which made it impossible to keep up.  What were those new rules? Two stories per day, each with 3-5 photos for the print edition, a photo gallery, and a video. Our computers had 4GB of ram to do these videos. When Lee Enterprises took over, I quit.   I do a little freelance now and then, but I'm mostly just writing my own stories on substack and getting back to writing that I love doing instead of writing bullshit that makes the editor happy, including not writing stuff because the editor can't handle the pressure from the mayor. Fuck. I need to stop because it all makes me sad and angry.

How is he unproveable? The Bible gives you some very specific instructions on how you can prove he exists, not the least of which believers should be able to command mountains to move .  What's your definition of disprove? You can disprove the stories of the Bible easy enough. The god described in the Bible can't exist because he's given conflicting attributes. Like I said above some of the claims made about him are patently false.   But here's the thing. I don't need to *disprove* him. You (or the person making the claim) need to prove their claims.   The universe had a creator. Prove it.   That creator is God. Prove it.   God doesn't need a creator. Prove it.

It's like difference between an American pizza and an Italian one. One is filled with toppings, loaded with sauce, fluffy bread, maybe even stuffed cheese crust. The other is a floppy soft thin crust with a small amount of sauce and a very few little toppings... German cordon Bleu is basically a schnitzel which they are already really good at making stuffed with multiple melted cheeses (which they are also really good at making) and finished with extra deli slices of ham inside (which Germans also really excel at). I really don't enjoy a basic schnitzel personally. It's just a thin slice of ham filet breaded and fried.. but their cordon Bleu takes it to a level that's worthy of it's fat content.

Credit. Never ever get into credit debt. Shit starts at 6% but average 15.9%. Seems innocent at $500 but snowballs quickly. Take a personal loan if need be is considerably lower. NEVER EVER GET IN REVOLVING CREDIT DEBIT!!! Even worse is a pay day loan. There is a reason military personnel are forbidden from doing it, there is almost no way out. Credit card interest can be really high especially starting out your financial path and you would not believe how it can railroad you‚Äôr future when you are worried about bills and making the minimum payment. Been there and forever done with that. This is not to put you in fear of credit cards, I use mine for cash rewards but pay it every month plus it builds your score.  There is a reason every store has a card and it‚Äôs in hopes to get your debt.

Understand that the image the camera captured is not the same as the subject in front of you. It's actually different. Often I think beginners see something interesting, point the camera at it, and press the shutter. "I took a picture of a good subject, therefore it must be a good photo." But the photo is more than the subject, it is a fully-realized 2-D composition. Learn to see the *entire image* you took. Look at the background, the foreground, the corners, the center the perimeter, everything. How do all the parts work together? Where is empty space, and where is busy space, and how do those relate to each other in a purely visual way? Learn to see how (for example) railroad tracks or a fence visually become a line which lead your eye to a certain spot, or how a lamp becomes a bright spot which attracts your eye, or how an object on the left balances an object on the right. Struggle to see the entire 2D image as a unified composition. Your photo is similar to a painting, in the sense that the placement of every element should be deliberately chosen. (This is actually much, much more difficult than it might seem at first to even understand, much less to master, so don't feel bad if you don't get it right away).

Yes I agree. But both of these examples were ‚Äúat work‚Äù- supposedly throwing shoes at extras and being kind to someone he literally did not have to speak to (me).

The speciesism part ended a good bit too fast, but everything else makes some sense.

Do you live in Calgary?
When I was 15, a group of female friends and I went bowling on a weekend night. We were just bowling and having fun. Some gross dude in his probably mid-twenties or so kept lingering around us and we thought it was weird but we ignored him, thinking he was just drunk and weird.  Eventually he kept approaching us, talking to us, making gross remarks. We told him we were only 15 and to back off. The man at the counter was watching but doing NOTHING about it. We kept telling the creepy guy to leave, we were just bowling and to go away.  He kept saying he didn't believe we were only 15. One of my friends went to the counter to complain but he guy said he couldn't do anything about it. What the hell??  He eventually stormed off to get more drunk and we finally left. I'm 38 now and it still pisses me off.

As a teen many years ago who wanted to and  attempting to off himself. This show is fairly real in the vision of teen suicide. The show is lame to me, but the entire show definitely portrays a lot of accurate feelings and judgements even with the survivors, as ive been the on the survivor side of friends killing themselves ad a teen too.

I was at this exact place two years ago and I had to drop out of college because I had no energy to go to class or do the work. I describe that period in my life like I was in a glass box, with pounds and pounds of pressure on me, pushing me down, but I couldn't get out, and no one could hear me.   I think the worst part about depression is that it makes you think you're completely alone, and no one understands what you're going through. But I've found, however morbid it may be, that talking out exactly how I'm feeling, the apathy, the suicidal thoughts, how I'd kill myself, helped a lot more than people telling me it will get better. It's nice to talk to someone who's been there and won't judge you for your thoughts, and not all therapists have been there.   All that to say, if you want to talk, literally about anything, you can reach out to me. It might be nice to tell a complete stranger how you feel, no judgement. :)

The entire world just got sat on the sofa for 18 months (and counting). The pandemic also caused shows that were meant to come out in that period to be delayed, so pickings were slimmer than usual.  As far as I can tell, nobody even considered doing a rewatch of Game of Thrones.  So thank you, Benioff and Weiss, you destroyed the legacy of the show that literally kicked off the high-budget epic model so thoroughly that it's been thrown down the Memory Hole. A crack team of infiltrators sent by Netflix to disrupt the production couldn't have done a better job of fucking it up.  I will never not be pissed off about this.

Ok so let's see the posts currently on the hot page:  1) https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/q51e9p/the_brand_maybe_needs_changing_from_prison_orange/  American uses their country's prison uniform as a critic on an Ukranian airline's color, no hateful comment saying Americans are dumb or anything.  2) https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/q57ahq/uk_is_a_country_and_everything_in_it_is_a_state/  American uses their country's dividing terms of states to wrongfully divide the UK, one comment from an American saying America has a lot of idiots which isn't hate-speech  3) https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/q56idv/american_cuisine_is_global_cuisine/  American trying to say their country has a bit of every nation's gastronomy in their cuisine, which isn't true at all. At most people are hating how much deep-frying Americans do which isn't hate-speech  4) https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/q4xlob/dont_have_to_be_american_to_be_asianamerican_right/  IMDB using terms which are almost exclusively used in America, people are making fun of the way some Americans use "African-American" to refer to any black person even if they're not American which isn't hate-speech  5) https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitAmericansSay/comments/q58awn/nobody_cares_if_aliens_invade_uruguay/  American says "The War of the Worlds" and other alien-invasion stories have to have America being invaded by the aliens implying that invading other countries like Uruguay wouldn't be as dramatic as they don't have such a big military force and it only made a good story because it put the strongest nation of the world going toe-to-toe against the alien invasion.  The reply in the post itself points out the story takes place in the UK, more specifically it takes place in Woking and nearby villages.  You may be thinking "Well the movie takes place in America!" but the American in the OG post clearly says that "**the original reason** why War of the Worlds was written" so they're technically talking about the book, which was adapted into the movie later on.  Comments are talking about the context as to how the alien-invasion trend started after WWII in *Europe* with Europe being invaded, and that the dude is crazy to think nobody that lives in a nation would care if it was invaded because it's not America, essentially saying that only Americans matter. No hate-speech here.  Can you **please** either back up your claims, stop being a snowflake that gets offended by puppets you've strung up?

I want people to prove they can handle a gun. And that isn't an invitation for a trip to the shooting range. Prove to a competent authority that you know how to safely load/unload a weapon, that you're of sound mind to only ever use it when absolutely necessary, that you'll keep it out of reach of a child/minor/person not of sound mind, who doesn't know how to handle a gun.  If you think the above is violating your constitutional rights/is too much to ask, then maybe you shouldn't be entrusted with the ability to own something that can gravely endanger the lives of many people.   There's no arguments against responsible gun ownership.

Hell yeah! Smiling is nice too.

Nope, i think people think this because Money For Nothing was one of the first videos to appear on MTV (the very first in the UK) and they were massive in the US  at the time. Technically they are Scottish though since both the Knopfler brothers were born in Scotland but moved to England when they were very young.
Doesn't sound worse than newer shows. There are so many that exploit the poor.
Hence why this show is fucking awful, also seeing Olive in hysterics for comedy is ridiculously fucked up.

Damn. That's pretty nice if you leave out the morning blowjob.
Having an extreme urge to do SOMETHING, but literally nothing is sufficient to motivate you to do anything so you settle for a "meh" level of activity.   &#x200B;  ie: You BADLY feel the need to go for a hike, but even the changing leaves and perfect weather and people trying to get you go is enough, so instead you watch 8 hours of a show you aren't even interested in just because there is a marathon of it on TV.  &#x200B;  For most (including me) Depression isn't "You are sad" its "You are emotionless and unable to find or do anything that makes you happy, also much more likely to become angry/frustrated then cheerful happy". Also, attempting to not act depressed is insanely exhausting, like the mental equivalent of running a marathon.

As an average height male (5'9"), I spent a lot of my 30's and 40's at under a hundred pounds.  I'm up to a healthy weight, but it's an effort, still.  Food is just something I need to take care of, like paying a bill.

cook a beautiful dinner for a family. then sit beside them having a happy family dinner, so that I can feel what it feels like to be surrounded by family who love each other. Sharing meals is often where people let down their guard, and it would feel nice to see people care about each other while enjoying something someone cooked for them in a warm, kind environment. Then I would leave, unjudged, content for having spent time around feelings of people who truly love each other.

Imagine looking at an abstract painting made up of greens, browns and greys, with tiny streaks of other colours, mainly purple and blue. Whenever you see a shade you identify with part of Britain, the painting changes into a fleeting vision of what you recognise: the lush greens of southern English grass in summer; the green, purple & brown of northern moorland, the dull green of suburban privet hedges, the grey of stolid Portland stone buildings, or the gentler greyish-brown of some rural buildings, the brown of slate roofs.

That's my story. I used to keep a water bottle of vodka in my cooler so I could stop the shakes if we worked late. I'm in construction. I've been in recovery for over 3 years. I went to a local nurse practitioner to detox and started going to AA meetings as soon as I could. I wish you luck and Google" AA near me". There will be many people who will help you if you're ready. If you drink like I did, you have a deadly disease that tells you that you don't have it. I was a sick person trying to get well.

Psychological torture while you cut their body parts off without anesthesia while they are alive
I mean it is probably the best excuse out of all excuses I have seen in the comments here. The reality is that your mental state is altered under the influence, and someone who can be the nicest moral saint while sober can become an ahole while drunk. People just say alcohol reveals your true self, but inhibiting your emotions is a key part of being a human.

He never paid a dime of child support, stole everything he could pawn from the house while my mom was working two jobs trying to dig herself out of the mess he left, and didn‚Äôt show when sister was nearly hospitalized for anorexia from the stress of it all.    They haven‚Äôt seen each other in over a decade now but every year he still claims my kid sister as a dependent on his taxes and any other shady tactics to benefit himself at the expense of his wife and child.

My friend confessed to me that when he was twelve, he dug up a grave and exhumed three bodies. Him and a few other reprobates then proceeded to slap the corpses around and eventually got around to playing football with their skulls. He's since died and was buried locally.   One night, not too long ago when the moon was bright, I got it into my head to go dig him up. It took a long time, they'd planted him deep like they knew something. The coffin lid had already caved in when I finally reached it, and what I saw inside I will take to my grave.

Even the revamp of inspector gadget is terrible. Everything is so stimulating and has no great concept.   The only thing my kids watch from Disney is Little Einstein‚Äôs which is a fantastic show but they stopped producing it because ‚Äúbaby Einstein‚Äù sued them for name right. Just change the name to ‚Äúlittle explorers‚Äù and move on Disney! Why stop producing such a great show?  PBS has a similar show but again it is actually very stimulating but visually and audio vise so I have to limit how much my kids watch it üòû  I created a playlist of the songs covered in little Einstein‚Äôs for my kids and now they listen to classical music thanks to that show.

Saved by the Bell was awful. I did watch it at one point because I was around the age of the actors, but as I got a bit older realized how terrible the acting was, how bad the writing was, the obviously low budgets, and so on.  Nobody older than about 12 should like it unless it's unironically.
I just couldn't keep watching it after awhile.   Another show that I had to drop because of how crazy/nonsensical the storyline got was Hemlock Grove.

As someone that's been working in Africa on and off since 2017. I would like this so much.   But adding to this, I would remove entire governments that are already functioning in those African countries. They are down right disgusting.   An example that I always tell people. We have contracted workers from the local area and when the contract was first set up the president of the country tried getting us to pay him so he could pay the locals on the contract. Instead of us paying the employees outright. That's a huge red flag and obviously the employees wouldn't get paid the proper wages if any at all.

The minister replied, kiss them and gift a pair of anklets, realising that none other than the emperor's newborn grandchildren could do that.

Friends of mine (a married couple) received a large legal settlement from an accident. They actually took a lesser amount to settle out of court so there was NO public record of the judgement. To this day, only me (a close friend of theirs) and the wife's mom (who is financially comfortable in her own right) know the actual dollar amount of the settlement.  The did not DARE tell anyone else because there would be a LINE of people with their hands out for a payout. When they asked (and they asked, a LOT), their stock response was "not nearly enough to compensate us for our life-long injuries." Eventually the questioning stopped but the reality is this couple could quit their jobs tomorrow and be fine financially for the rest of their days.

I think it was actually season 2. Idk, I love my wife and she's a very intelligent nurse herself, but her TV watching habits are disturbing.

Im very picky about what I watch so it would be something I watched because I was there and had little choice.  The worst would be Eastenders. Yes the multi-award winning long running UK soap. Why is it the worst? Well, sure it does have well written, well acted stories that are cutting edge social commentary, but thats only like 5% of it. The rest is monumental garbage.  There are episodes which i swear would fit on a single sheet of paper, there is so little dialogue and little action. It is mostly boring and miserable and I can see more interesting things looking out my windows, in a fairly safe, boring cul-de-sac.  Its on way too often and clearly the writers just cant find anything to fill the time with.

Greeley County, Kansas.  All of the land in the County.  I don't currently live in it, but I'd like to own an entire goddamned county and its the least populated county (1200 people) in the state.  At a size of 780 SQ.MI. and an average land cost of 2000 $/acre, it'd cost about $1 billion to buy.  Haven't decided if I'd just buy it all and then let everyone just pay me rent.  Or buy it all and kick them all out.  Close down all the local roads, no gas stations off the highways, knock everything down, and build me a hobbit home.  I'd probably flip a coin tbh.  And I could find out all the fun things you could do governmentally if you're the only resident of a County.  Can I rename a county?  What laws/rules can I set?  Can I change the timezone, so that Greeley County is 'legally' in the same time zone as New Zealand?

Make a testing lab and getting a whole shitton of sientist to make a rat army that can follow orders. My army would be in the billions to spread disease and infest places i am fighting. The american army would get scared and try to kill me. I pay them 1 mill to keep Quite. If that doesnt work 100m. If thst doesnt work then i will take over america, and come out as leader after killing anyone who opposes me. A resistance started, and i cant infest the base because its got metal as outer walls. No matter, ill just hire a real soldier army full of past mercenarys and marines and high ranked army men. I break their base open like a peanut. I find their leader and my army kills his guards. I thought i finally had america, but just then members of the Allies come in from behind. We fight as hard as we can but its of no use, they outnumber us 100 to 1. So i make the call to release a prototype rat breed, it can carry diseases and be fine because the immune system is practically holding it in place due to   many yeats of breeding and editing to make this rat. They come here and a disease that gets contagious 1 hour after getting it, courtsy of us. We hold our ground for 2. This disease targets the brain and makes you paralized in a few hours. We hold up with the leader of the rebelion takes out a hidden weapon and aims for the head of me. He gets tackled by my guards and he gets a hit in. I feel a warm liquid fall down the lower back of my chest to my leg. I got shot in a nonvital place but i cant manage to fight like this. Luckly i thought to bring a medic just in  case. I get it cauterized, disinfected, and bandaged. They set up explosives outside the metal sealed shut door. Its thick enough to take a blast but another would break the door wide open. We have minutes to get ready to fight when they blast the door open. I tell my men to get behind some cover, the chairs and desk are the best we can find, this is bad. They blast the door open and come in. We wait a moment, leader at gunpoint, and then we start firing. Its a lost cause, but worth a shot. As my men go down i pop up with the leader as a hostage. I start walking out of the base as soon as i let the leader go i get in my hidden heli and get myself out of their. I go into hiding after escaping. I make a fake name and get plastic surgery. I get new papers and drivers license. I live out the rest of my life in peace. Or do i...

You can order iced coffee and ask for it with milk and classic syrup (sugar syrup) and ask for extra pumps of syrup to make it sweeter. I like to ask for vanilla sweet cream added, it‚Äôs a mix that reminds me of a creamer, it‚Äôs pretty sweet. If you like milk you could get an iced latte like vanilla, caramel, or mocha that would be sweet as well with coffee flavor. So you would say the size (tall, grande, venti) then say iced and then your drink order. So like grande iced coffee with extra vanilla sweet cream. Or venti iced caramel latte. Or a tall iced coffee with 2% milk and 2 pumps extra of classic syrup. You can also just let the barista know you want an iced coffee that tastes sweet (with or without milk), and they‚Äôll be able to make an order for you.

Wow. Everything you just wrote is false. First of: Tell me where in the Bible does it say that gay people are sinners? Second: Doesn‚Äòt your religion teach that you should love your neighbor? Third: We do not - and I repeat - we do not want to destroy families. All we want is to be able to live the ways we feel comfortable. You are the kind of person who would hurt, injure or even kill people just because of their sexual preferences. What have LGBT people done to you? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The way we live is not up to you. Tell me how me liking both men and women effects you in any way. How does me not feeling comfortable with the gender roles I was assigned at birth have anything to do with you. All we want is equal rights. Equal. we do not want to take away your rights. We just want the same. Us getting more rights does not mean you get less. It‚Äòs not a cake. Also:  indoctrinate children? Seriously? Is it not indoctrinating forcing your kids to go to church every Sunday and obey rules written in a book some thousand years ago? We only tell children that it is ok to live however you want. You on the other hand tell them they have to listen to some old man in the sky or else they will burn and suffer for eternity. That is really fucked up. Damn I am glad I left church. If you think what you just wrote is right and just because of your religion you did not understand what Jesus Christ taught. He spoke of love. So do we.

How many of those do you do? Because I do some of those (gym, instrument, try to be social, sometimes cooking better meals, and other hobbies like hiking) and between that and work/household chores I don‚Äôt often feel like I‚Äôve got very much time.   Of course there‚Äôs still time to jerk off and masturbation is healthy but if you‚Äôre feeling like you may have a porn addiction then it‚Äôs time to start jerking off without porn imo. An addiction to anything isn‚Äôt healthy.  I‚Äôm not expecting ou to answer but how easy is it for you to get hard without porn or some other stimulus? If it‚Äôs difficult then you should probably try to focus on doing the deed without porn.

I was going to say, there was one mom I saw on that show who had lost her front teeth in some accident and had no money to afford new ones. You could tell it devastated her self esteem.

Johnny Bravo
Honestly, all reality shows similar to Survivor.   While the challenges can be interesting, people watch (at least in part) to enjoy watching real people experience real pain & trauma. Do some deserve it? Sure. Did they know what they were getting into? Again, sure.   But this isn't watching actors pretend to be emotionally or physically hurt. It's real people suffering on camera, and I cannot believe so many humans enjoy watching that.

That‚Äôs because you have a complete misunderstanding at who‚Äôs fault it is for the lockdowns. The so-called ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù are not the ones locking you down. They are just the scapegoat for the ruling class. It‚Äôs the political and corporate class who is locking you down and it‚Äôs for no benefit at all.  Biden has even said that things will not go back to normal until we get 96-97% of the country. This will never happen. This is after he postulated that vaccine mandates would never be enforced under his presidency and that 70% vaccination rate would be sufficient. We will never meet their objectives because it‚Äôs not about public health. It‚Äôs about control.

Heart health. I had a heart attack at 34 caused by a SCAD (spontaneous coronary artery dissection). This condition is typically found in young healthy women, but when you think heart attack you only think of older men. Women‚Äôs heart attack symptoms can also be very different than men‚Äôs. I‚Äôm very lucky the er I ended up in was familiar with SCAD, but many women go undiagnosed and have multiple heart attacks.

From a 2008 email I sent out that got back to me recently. .  So this year I went out on a mission. To give out roses to friends, family,¬†and more importantly¬†many random unsuspecting people on the street. In other words my extended family. All just because I just wanted to make some people¬†smile¬†from a free rose¬†they wouldn't even see coming for them. My goal was to spread spontaneous happiness. I didn't have a Valentine.. so I figured I'd make everyone else mine. I got up around 11 am, went¬†to the local flower shop¬†bought 3 dozen roses ($156.00 very well spent), then¬†I began my mission. I went to my Moms house first, of course, left her a rose on the kitchen table since she wasn't home, and then headed east. Long story short I proceeded to hand out roses to random people¬†all day and night.¬†Elderly women in walkers trudging through the whats left of the Chicago snow, two very precious small children walking with their Mother, young men and women walking down the street, a quirky but lovably hip coffee shop clerk, a handsome bartender, a homeless man begging for change in the middle of traffic and a used bookstore patron looking for that perfect novel etc, etc.. This one was the best though (thanks Dave and Mary for the idea!).... I went through the drive thru at McDonalds and btw¬†I don't eat at McD's, they creep me out! Anyways I¬†handed a rose to the drive thru attendant, told her Happy Valentines Day,¬†and took my drink which I ordered. She blushed and said thanks. I was about to pull away, but I paused, thought to myself¬† for a moment and gave the attendant another rose and told her I wanted to pay for the persons food who was in the car behind me. I paid for their meal and I instructed her to give them the second rose that I had just handed her. She asked me what my name was and I said it didn't¬†matter and drove¬†off¬†smiling. I¬†completed¬†my Valentines mission around 11:30 pm. So on Feburary 14, 2008 I took about a¬†12 hour shift volunteering my time for the benefit of mankind. For my lonely hearts out there, here I was... to the rescue! I loved it! I love it! The face of an unsuspecting¬†person to receive a symbol of love for absolutely no reason and on top of that from someone whom they didn't even know! ..Oh! that look¬†on someones face is priceless. Such a happy, joyful¬†one! At first its a kind of shock, then embarrassment, then appreciation and then by the time they're wanting to thank me,¬†I've already ran off plotting to commit another senseless act of kindness in the streets of Chicago. Knowing that they'll¬†probably never see me again is an awesome¬†feeling of selfless generosity and is¬†simply quite amusing. If only I could do this everyday? If my soul¬†could¬†smile,¬†this is would be the best way to describe how these acts¬†made¬†me feel inside. But right now even¬†while I'm¬†writing this I feel like I'm¬†about to cry¬†and I'm breaking up inside¬†knowing that man shot all those people in DuPage on the same day. For what!? Things are so sad, so depressing¬†out there sometimes.¬†I feel "the city's gonna break¬†your heart" has deep meaning in Honky Cat by Elton John. But we insist on only breaking our own hearts here because we think we're alone.¬†Fear and consumption, fear and consumption. Afraid to love, afraid to show affection for one another. In a way I'm not surprised why¬†this shit happens. So many lost children.¬†We don't even acknowledge each¬†other when we walk down the street! I understand why I feel sad and alone sometimes. Hopeless people out there alone, wandering in the streets. Why¬†can't we just doing something nice for¬†one another without expecting anything in return? People always think you have some hidden agenda, or want a favor, or your trying to work them over when its just you wanting to do something nice for them. It doesn't have to be this way, but¬†this¬†isn't the point to me writing this.¬†Its¬†very easy to be apathetic nowadays. Yes it is hard and yes it takes a little bit of effort and time to go out of your way¬†and do something nice for someone besides yourself. But if¬†more people did things like this we all would probably be in a much better place.¬†Seriously! I doubt many of you are¬†aware but its Random Acts of Kindness week. Go look it up if you don't believe me. So go out and do something good for someone. Maybe we can start some sort of a karmic chain reaction. Its really great¬†what one individual can do for¬†others because we all treat our loved ones this way. We know how to love the ones who show us love. What about everybody else out there? Common people show some love and let it spread. Imagine what a group of dedicated¬†people could do for each other?¬†All you've got to do is¬†try. I love yall. I hope you're all well these days. Thanks for your time.

Chronic pain sufferer reporting in. The pain usually hits me hardest when I change position - like laying down every night.   Delta 8 edibles are a godsend. It‚Äôs legal (or at least a very fuzzy gray area in the US) according to the 2018 Farm bill. It‚Äôs sold in retail stores (and that will be my alibi if it ever becomes an issue). It doesn‚Äôt hit you as quickly as pot which I was never a fan of (too much of a straight edge and control freak). It sneaks up on you gradually - like over an hour.   Even if I‚Äôm not getting a full 8 hours, I seem to be sleeping deeper and more restful than without the help.
Try some herbs. If you are in America, the newly legal kind will do you just fine. I have migraines & also battle off & on with insomnia.

Demi Lovato. I USED to be a big fan of her up until she became political and look at her now.
I learned that a lot of advice I had heard about how men are and how to treat/talk to men was a lot of gendered bullshit. My husband is completely different from a lot of what I had come to expect from men. I even have two male friends that love female-coded entertainment - ie romcoms and real housewives type shows - and female authors. I'm not into that stuff personally, but over time started to find it really cool that they were just immune to social pressure around liking things "for women".  My husband didn't know that people with vaginas have to shit all the time when they're on their period. Something about tummy contractions.

Oh boy do I have a story for this one. This may come across as a pittle modest but, I think my prank was the best in my high school. Here's how it went: It was my senior year, (senior prank) and as far as I knew, no one else had had a plan for their senior prank. But I, I had been planning. Since freshman year I had thought up a devious idea. I wanted to do a prank that was completely harmless, but would both be really funny for me and also the teachers. (It would also not get me in any troucle as far as I knew, and it didn't so that was good.) I decided I wanted to set up an alias for myself, the name was; *The Prego Pirate* . My plan? I would stock up on jars of Prego Marinara sauce. Then, while the teacher was away or their door was open, I would slip a jar onto their desk. Super simple but it would mess with their psyche, like, "Where did this jar come from? Why Prego Marinara sauce? Why does this keep happening? Who is doing this?" I would also need to get the help and undying support of my entire class. Then I needed to plan out the teachers that I would strike. Specifically I had selected one teacher in particular who I would focus my strikes on, she was my English teacher and for the sake of the story she shall be called Ms. Smith. I also selected a few other teachers and would eventually do random places down the line. But Ms. Smith was vital to the plan. She was an older woman but I knew she would both enjoy it and take up the challenge that would ensue. This teacher also only had me for one semester, she knew me well, but not well enough to have her suspect me. Finally, after years of planning, it was time for the execution. It was the second semester, I wanted to do my prank towards the end so it felt like I couldn't get into as much trouble, I was kind of worried about that cause I was a good boy and didn't want that on my record although personally now that would have been really funny to explain. But anyways, i had my supply of Prego ready to go, I had my teachers selected, and I had plenty of people in on it. Then came the first week of my plan. For the first week I wanted to focus my strikes on Ms. Smith that way I could peak her intrigue and get her suspicious of people, which she suspected most of my really close friends, so, sorry to them lol. But the first day I had planned for one of my friends to distract her while I would slip a jar onto her desk. But what I didn't expect was that friend got a ton of people I think it was like 12 people to just swarm her. It was perfect, I quickly slipped past and into her room and swung out. It was genuinely like a pefectly executed heist. I've never heen more proud. Second day wasn't so easy, and the rest wouldn't be either as now her gaurd was up. She was on the lookout. I was still able to get friends to successfully distract her but she was now suspicious of them and actually started accusing them. But the plan still went down. The third day was when things started to get a little more difficult. She started to close her door so I couldn't just slip in, now I had to rely on a different approach. Thankfully their was another way. Since this was during covid, the teachers were allowed to take their classes out to go on "mask breaks." This was my window, it was only 15 minutes, but it was all I would need. And thanks to teachers not being able to fully close their doors, again due to covid I could still easily get in. Now I just needed a friend in her class to tell me when she went on mask break so I could quickly say, "I have to use the bathroom," and slip out with a jar comically in my pocket. It was quite goofy, but it worked. This would be my approach for the rest of the week. Finally on the last day of the week I decided I would introduce my alias, The Prego Pirate. I had typed out a beautifully crafted letter that would both intrigue her and enact a challenge. The challenge was to correctly identify me by the end of the semester before school ended. The reward for identifying me would be a box of spaghetti noodles hand delivered by me, but I was not worried about this because her suspicions were most definitely not on me. She was accusing her class and my friends and it was great. She had absolutely no idea. From this point things continued to go on at a decent pace. I started "prego-ing" other teachers using the same methods and really nothing to interesting happened. It was closing in on the final week of school and I wanted to spice things up and get ready for my last push. I decided to type her another letter, this one would have two ways to identify me. The one was quite a brilliant code that I had made that fully contained my name. The other was a riddle that when solved would give the name of the final teacher I would Prego. At this point I had prego'd about a dozen other teachers and places and I even got a friend to print out a bunch of wanted posters that he hung around the school. Tensions were high. I also decided as per many of my friends request that I wluld reveal myself to her on the last day if she didn't identify me so I came up with a pretty shabby but funny plan for that but that was to come. Finally it came to my last prego jar in which I did the slowest, I wanted to take my time so that she could potentially catch me in the act. But alas, she did not. The Prego Pirate walked free. I decided for my big reveal that I would "solve the code" from that letter and have my friends convince her that I was an, "Expert Code Solver." Which was really dumb but it worked. Many people knew about this prank so it was easy to convince her that I knew about the letter. I also decided that I would give her a box of spaghetti upon my reveal just as a final huzzah. Also, a ton of my friends wanted to see the reveal so it was quite funny on the last day a ton of seniors just swarming into this poor english teacher's room trying to convince her about my "code solving skills." Finally I "cracked the code" in front of her with perhaps my greates quote, "I'm not sure, but I- I think the Prego Pirate (at this point I had a friend reach into my bag and grab the spaghetti to give to her) but I think the Prego Pirate is *ME*." The noodles were placed onto her desk as if it was a mic drop amd the room quite literally burst into laughter. She was baffled, she had genuinely no suspicion of me. It was actually really funny because she had come up to me and asked me about the Prego Pirate, but she wasn't accusing me, she was just asking if I knew anything about it. And honestly thank covid for masks, becasue if she saw the massive smile that I had it would have been over. She also loved that so many people were in on it, I'm pretty sure eventually the entire school knew it was me which was pretty crazy since yeah I told a lot of people but not the entire school. At the end I had told her to donate the jars and noodles to a local food bank as they take that stuff. And overall I think it went super well and genuinely was pretty funny to see play out according to my plans. And again it was absolutely harmless which was what I truly wanted. It wasn't a stupid "devious lick" or any stupidity like that. Just one man, a bunch of Prego( I think it ended up being like 30 or so jars) and a bunch of awesome friends to aid me in this crazy endeavor. Would I do it again in college? Absolutely.

Fair answer
I'm pretty sure that the guy who wrote that missed the point of Economics. Economics isn't like meteorology, it's like climatology. You aren't trying to predict the stock market, the stock market is a measure of *investor expectations*. Economists are trying to develop the basic information that is later used by people in Finance to predict the stock market.  You can get mad about climatologists not predicting snow all you want, but you're complaining at the wrong person.

Yeah I mean it's tough to go through bad periods like this. I've had some pretty weird ones myself. It always helps me to focus on something outside myself, and when I can't, not overprocessing but just sitting with my breathing.

It was my dad. For almost my whole life, I‚Äôve held a grudge as he was physically and sexually abusive to me. A couple of years ago, my counselor helped me to see that this grudge was keeping me chained to him. Every time I was reminded of him, all the anger would well up in me again. He said that I was letting my dad live rent-free in my head. Wow! After some very hard work, I let the grudge go. This does not mean it excused what he did to me, and I kept the boundary that he would never be in my life for my protection. It was one of the most healing things I‚Äôve ever done. Now I‚Äôm free!

With essential hygiene products and household cleaners being expected to rise in price even more due to inflation, do you have any at-home recipes that you use for shampoo, conditioner, or hand-soap that are comparable to a store-bought quality, not containing any compounds that are ‚Äúforever chemicals/compounds‚Äù that get absorbed into the body via the skin? (PFAS, whatever is going on with forever-compounds in makeup, lotions, hygiene products like shampoo or conditioner.)   Any dish soap recipes? Other household cleaner recipes?  We either are going to be eating the dog shit laid from our corporate overlords chihuahua‚Äôs and be shoveling out money for bars of soap to shower with in the next two-three years probably (AM GUESSING based on current conversations) and I don‚Äôt wanna spend $7 for a single bar of soap in the potentially very near future

Oh it constantly is. Imagine knowing large parts of your family doesn't give a shit about you. While they act like they do in front of other people. Like them full on joining up together regularly to make your life and the lives of others and themselves worse like clockwork. For no logical reason what so ever. Then watching as their actions slowly kill any and every last person around them. Choking the life out of them so that they don't appreciate the little time we have left on earth. Without them being antivaxxers.

Sex is important to my guy and he's happy when I give him orgasms.  It's a way he connects emotionally and physically with me and he's a pushover with all the things I ask him to do to maintain our relationship.  I like sex but he really loves it so it's a nice little gift, like a backrub, but I just have to clean up after.  It's fun because he'll stop anything at the drop of a hat, me saying, "Hey, wanna cum?"

But discrimination against white people just can't be compared to discrimination against other races. If someone says something bad about white people as a whole, it's just mean, and it's not going to have a strong impact. But if someone does the same against marginalized races, it reinforces existing and widely held prejudiced beliefs about that group. There needs to be a distinction made.  With genders, I would say men are also oppressed, since there are beliefs and systems that disproportionately affect them, and sexism causes men to have worse emotional health on average and so on. But white people don't face anything like this because of their race.

Step 1 : Buy GPU's in bulk, save cost, distribute it to the people.  Step 2 : Wear Cape.  Step 3 : Watch the fall of civilization as everyone burns so much electricity that blackouts cripple the world and Amazon becomes the only source of delivering necessities to the people in need.  Step 4 : Use this to get Bezos go ahead to back the one in charge of Amazon.  Step 5 : Call yourself GPU-Man.  Step 6 : Using your overwhelming influence convince the world that GPU's are the new global currency, and everyday items will be traded with it as the standard. As only a set amount of GPU's can be made, this makes complete sense.  Step 7 : Write a book with a quote something along the lines of:   >"Power to the people ... oops."  Step 8 : Divide humanity into 3 tribes, the tribes of N-vidiana, Intellious and AMDara. Bring them together to fight in the "Power Hunger Games". Winner gets the all powerful golden sample.

Again, I lived in Norway and have many friends still there. That style of social democracy is (I feel) more fair and just than what we have in the US. As the cost is spread out across the general population and economy and not borne by the individual.   My friends working there in comparable jobs pay about 2x what I do in taxes, but don‚Äôt have expenses like I did with healthcare, education and childcare. They also have a quality of life that is much better than the average American. However, to call healthcare free (especially when you figure VAT into the mix), isn‚Äôt true. Furthermore, it doesn‚Äôt prepare us to answer the rhetoric by the other side.

US state/federal park police are some of the chillest authority figures you'll ever meet. But if you 1) disrespect the park or 2) blow them off as "not real" cops, they're going to be pissed. Both of those attitudes show you're not going to follow the rules of the park that keep you and others safe (e.g. your stoned ass will try making friends with a bear)... and if the ranger has to arrest you, the nearest holding facility may be over an hour away, which is a waste of everyone's time when visitors could just follow the rules and be chill.

I have never been pregnant, but spironolactone is an anti-androgen; it suppresses the action of testosterone in the body and lowers the amount, so there's not really a corresponding agent related to pregnancy. However, I do know from the pickle references I've seen in pop culture that it's usually to represent food cravings that seem strange; pregnant women do get cravings for things their body needs, and they're going through a lot of physiological change. If salt is the thing they need, pickles are probably going to sound pretty good.

One of the most awkward moment of my life was when my friend was telling me about a guy who was too rough on the clit. Suddenly she's like, "This is how you should do it" and started rubbing more arming with two fingers **real** gentle.    I hate to let the scarring experience go to waste but since I can't reach through the screen and rub your arm just start super soft and adjust according to feedback. When she did it, her fingers were barely touching. But of course, every woman will have her own preference.

I think also guys whose only achievement was being popular in school and getting laid might care about virginity as well, as a way to feel superior to others.  I remember a bunch of guys harassing me on a bus a few years back and bragging about how they've all done *it*. A incredibly awkward and pathetic situation all around. Now I don't often feel too good about myself, but the realization that a group of people can be so excited with themselves they need to put down a stranger because they scored a embarassing *first time* with a local girl behind a barn and they consider it a big enough achievement that everyone else must be a virgin - that realization was a feeling of pure bliss for me.  It's worth reminding yourself that whether you've experienced sex, traveled abroad, finished college, got a career, started a family etc. is completely inconsequential to how you feel about yourself, unless you yourself put it up as the golden standard for a good life and judge yourself and others based on it.

You are forced to use worn out tools or equipment. You are no longer payed overtime. Days off are not possible for now. You have to work on more projects simultaneously because some people quit, a lot of people leave; high fluctuation. Your boss ask you to go to the doctor and get an health certificate (in Europe the insurance pays you for your sick days). Your boss ask you to go back to work even if you are on holiday or sick days. Most relevant point for me, the responsible person is not available anymore.

I never understood the hate that 'Teen Titans Go!' recieves.   I was a kid when OG Teen Titans came out and it was one of the best shows of my childhood so I understand why people were so disappointed when it was discontinued. But TTG! was a completely different and far more cartoonish show. It may share it's voice actors with 'Teen Titans' but 'Teen Titans: Go!' is it's own entirely unrelated show.  I watch it as an adult for the same reason I watch Spongebob; it's ridiculous and hilarious and I love the characters.  Edit: added some missing spaces between words.

So a friend of mine's a psychologist. One day she got a call from the divorce lawyer renting the office next door. He asked her to come over and talk to his client whose wife was apparently going crazy.  She comes on over to see none other than Mickey Mouse in the office. The lawyer says "My friend here is a therapist. Before going straight to divorce, I really think you ought to get Minnie some help if she's going crazy."  Mickey turns to him and says, "I didn't say she was going crazy, I said she was fucking Goofy"  It's an old joke, but your comment made me think of it.

Me and a couple of friends we're sleeping over at one of my friends Nathans house because it was his birthday the next day. We were all watching the movie Deadpool. Towards the end of the movie everyone but me and one other dude were asleep. He said he was hungry so we went to the kitchen to grab a snack. When we got to the kitchen we heard a noise coming from up stairs so we go look. As we walk up the stairs we see Nathans sisters door slightly open. As we push it open we see his sister and her friend standing half naked making a tik tok. They hear us and look right as we run off. We quickly went down stairs and pretend we were asleep. We assumed that they didn't see our faces. The next day we tried to talk to them as little as possible hopeing that they don't notice us. Later that day about 8:00 Nathan and his parents went out to see his grandma. So they put his older sister in charge. She didn't really care about what we did as long as nothing broke around 11:00 Nathan and his parents got home and we all went to bed. Then I get woken up by someone shaking me. I rub my eyes and see his sister. She tells me to come with her. We go up to her room and her friend is there holding what looked like a condom. His sister pushes me on the bed and takes my pants off her friend give me the condom and I put it on then we did it. They told me to go back down stairs quietly and go to bed. The next day I go home and she adds me on Instagram. So I ask her if she new it was me and my friend who saw her and her friend half naked she said she only seen me. I no longer talk the those friends.

Omg I was a researcher and I specialised in genetics which my supervisor did not but he liked to think he understood it and oh man.... like the examples would bore you but basically I'd try to explain why X could not be done or wouldn't work and they'd offer to send me on a course to learn how.  No man... like.... ....... plz......

In February in Maine so it was negative 13 degrees outside. Back of a Ford Fiesta. He killed the engine so no one would hear us parked. So it was freezing. He wore fingerless leather gloves the entire time. I didn't realize but I had a latex allergy and my vagina swelled up and it killed any lubrication I would have been able to create. I wasn't into it. I wanted to be but I wasn't.  It was lackluster, not special, and the guy was like 7 years older than I was. I just pray my daughter's have much more romantic experiences than I did with guys they actually give a shit about.
good god, that one is so true

Let them get real jobs. They don't want to work is the issue. So lazy, they've never had to fend for themselves. Give them minimum wage and watch the world become a better place
Yeah that's my recollection as well.  Sometimes a guy would come by and take you to a building or something but mostly stuck in holes.  I could get out easy enough, its the not falling right back in part that eluded me.

Jesus no kidding.  There is no way in hell I've ever seen an infosec applicant come out of college with anything resembling specialist skills.  Ideally college develops foundational skills so you can functionally on the job train. For some fields it also develops necessary safety or particularly difficult skills to develop outside a controlled environment.  This is why college is so broad, the goal is develop any foundational skills you might need, and some elective foundational skills that are likely to assist you in a competitive work environment (like foreign language).

I don't listen to either of these bands but I feel like Exodus or Testament are the next in line. Really it's a hard call because there weren't really a lot of big thrash bands in the grand scheme of things.  Though these days I guess there would be an argument for Lamb of God if you want to talk modern bands.

Depends on whether you have rational definitions of racism and sexism.  If so, no. I do believe a lot of folks who identify as xonservative also happen to be racist and/or sexist, however, the same is true for people who identify as liberal or progressive if you use objective and unbiased definitions of racism and sexism.    It modern society, especially American society, these terms are manipulated to be used as political tools, not as objective or productive social critiques. They are fairly effective tools because American society tends to have a subjective and reactionary reactionary retributive approach to social justice, rather than an objective roactive restorative approach. Mainly because the former is much easier to impose than the latter, and requires a lot less self criticism.

I just finished the citizens police academy for my town.  One of the big things they stressed is to call.  The officer might be annoyed in the moment, but that's ok.  Most officers would much rather come out for nothing than not get the call and have to do a homicide investigation.    You also never know what else is happening around you-there may have been other complaints, and there might be something going on and your call might be the clue that gets someone off the streets.  Odds are after they leave your place, they are knocking on someone else's door, and knowing where they have been can help them track where they might be going.  And if they do have nefarious intent and leave before the police get there, trust me they are watching to see who calls and who doesn't, and will avoid the area next time if they know you aren't afraid to do something.

Careful, buddy. Telling the truth can be dangerous business.
I worked night shift at a casino.      Around 3am, the vibe changes.  Where I live, you can't serve alcohol between 2am and 11am. So by 3am, everyone has finished their drinks.  Some people are still coming in after 2, having finished drinking at a bar and are looking to continue their fun into the night.  By 3, those people are starting to leave.    The only ones left are the ones who have a problem. Some are regulars who are there all night every night.   Others came early in the night for fun, and won big early on, but didn't know when to quit. Their friends have already left, and it's just them, alone, trying to win back their money so they don't have to explain to their wife that they just gambled away their savings, but they're only digging themselves into a deeper hole.      I know the odds haven't changed, but after 3am it really seems that people don't win as much.  It seems that this is when the house starts clawing back its winnings.       TL:DR; If you're still gambling at 3am, stop. Go home.

Shit, I feel called out. I use it to vent sometimes. I'd say instead of a therapist I use it as a replacement for journaling or screaming into the void. When I was journaling it wasn't helping as much since I would reread it and get more stressed. It helps because I occasionally get feedback and I get things off of my chest that keep me awake at night. Therapists are expensive, too.

Imo one only uses these prefered pronouns if they actually respect the person in question. Considering that this threat is about people you have no respect for i think it's reasonable or at least understandable that one would disrespect her chosen identity.  Also using they/them when talking about a person that is known kind of makes it sound like they are multiple people to me, which can be very confusing.   Also i dont mean to sound like i don't approve of different pronouns, it's just this particular choice i really dont like.

You could also argue there are two similar double standards:  If some people are so worried about the life of a fetus (not yet human by most peoples‚Äô accounts), why aren‚Äôt the majority of these people also vegan? Why don‚Äôt they care about actually fully conscious, emoting beings and their innocent slaughter? I must admit, I‚Äôm not vegan myself but have complete respect for them. There‚Äôs definitely a double standard here  And also that many of those who are suddenly opposed to these vaccines don‚Äôt actually care about their health. They‚Äôll happily take anonymous recreational drugs on the weekend, smoke or vape (carcinogenic studies coming out now), cook with Teflon, handle BPAs, have formaldehyde in their furniture and carpets, and so on.

We literally invented cyberbullying. It seems way more tame nowadays on that front than it was before. There was a huge push from about 2004-2009 about it because it was becoming so common for kids to be cyberbullied so badly that they killed themselves. There were tons of made for TV movies and episodes of shows about it. Kids didn‚Äôt seek online fame in the way they do now, and all that energy was put into ruining the lives of someone you didn‚Äôt like.

Security of the butterflies?  Security is when you feel like nothing else can get to you as easily, it‚Äôs all there before you but you aren‚Äôt as terrified, you know someone you love is always there waiting for you, protecting you, watching over you.  Butterflies in the stomach are more like the fleeting feeling of excitement, you feel all giddy like you‚Äôre drunk on love, you feel fearless then too but in the sense that you‚Äôre too oblivious to read through the lines and pick up on important things.
I can recall watching a documentary on it, although I haven‚Äôt for the life of me been able to find it again, where they were interviewing people in the streets and people were going ‚ÄòOh yes I killed nine people,‚Äô ‚ÄòI killed six people.‚Äô Absolutely crazy, but you think they can‚Äôt possibly imprison all the people who took part, there were just too many.
Mostly because this is *so* fucking misfortune and bad, and went so horribly wrong all of a sudden, that your psyche needs a way out before collapsing.

It was just something she had grown up with.

And every time it happens I think to myself.  Mother fucker wtf is this nasty ass shit you smoking. Go get a better dealer, this is clearly shit weed

The Max Headroom signal hijacking occurred on the night of November 22, 1987, when the television broadcasts of two stations in Chicago, Illinois, United States, were hijacked in an act of broadcast piracy by a video of an unidentified person wearing a Max Headroom mask and costume, accompanied by distorted audio and with a corrugated metal panel swiveling in the background to mimic Max Headroom's geometric background effect. https://youtu.be/jjeUuakHsLw

College. We had a group project for finals, but my group isn't really working well together so we relayed the issue to our professor and asked her if we could do something else. She then gave us the option to choose between not giving up on the group project or just take an exam. We decided on the latter. Professor raged verbally then started posting degrading stuff online with our names for her students to see. Since then, she particularly detested me during class and none of us understood why despite everyone's awareness of the entire situation. I've never even talked her down.  Fast forward, the rest of the class had their finals done while we the examinees have an hour (less because she was intentionally late for 15-20 minutes) to answer a test with 300 items worth 300 points. Half of it was essay worth 1 point each. No time extensions. The hardest part was that it was an advanced Japanese language class, so yeah, you are expected to handwrite in a different and complicated language from your native one. I managed to finish more than half.  Anyway, still passed the class because I already had perfect scores with the rest of the grading. All these happened because we couldn't do what she wanted yet girl couldn't fail me lol.

Maybe ask this question at r/DataScience? They could probably give a more qualified answer.   I don't have verified source for the following: Some time ago I read about something like "Instagram could predict that your relationship will break soon and shows you content that consolidates your opinion and view about your life that you already have" by evaluating User Behaviour at the Platform. And if that's true it would be easy to predict which products suit your expectations the most.  And what's verified (I guess) is that social media Platforms don't evaluate your behaviour seperated but in combination with using behaviour of your friends on the platforms. Example one of your friends on insta liked a picture or recently buyed something, the Data is collected. Their Profile is sorted into some kind of Data grid. And if your data matches this grid enough you are more likely to receive similar ads.

You were at least taught about stranger danger.

We dont know anything until at least half a generation of humans later whenever something new happens. You seem quite  paranoid and see shadows that harm you everywhere.  If you start questioning in that direction then life will become a lot harder to you. Vaccines, 5g, gmo, etc so many things that when introduced have not been tested enough to see if humans will get long term damage by it. If we don't try to improve our situation we might as well just go back to the middle ages.  Advancements are always bound to risks. Waiting to see what happens in like 20 years is usually jjst a waste of time.

Honestly I think hospitals are also... fucking scary today.  You get sick and you could wake up tied down with a tube down your throat.  Two of my grandparents had that and said they'd rather be dead.  I don't know what the solution is to all the traumatizing procedures, but for sure we need to acknowledge that a lot of people are going to have PTSD after hospitalization.

You can read between the lines of his answers to see what he's saying. At the time this interview was taken, he'd been in position around 6 months. Serving bureaucrats are very limited in what they can say without punishment of one kind or another. He can't just dive in and override existing processes for determining causation because he doesn't like the outcomes, and he can't explicitly blame specific parts of the organisation, and he has to follow the law as written and not criticise is as a bad or poor law. Good bureaucrats are skilled at finding a lawful way to get a good outcome without breaking the law, exposing themselves to criticism from politicians or directly overriding operational decisions, but unfortunately it takes time. That's the cost of the rule of law and having an independent and impartial civil service.

I think you've highlighted one of the strongest possible answers here to deny the premise. If you start with denying the premise, I don't know how either side could convince the other and you kinda end up in a frustrating stalemate tho :/ kinda kills the question without answering it.  It's a great defense of policy but there's no reasoning there. It's bridging the gap by refusing to look down and hoping for the best

As a girl dating another girl, I'm attracted to the similar mindset and emotional IQ all women share. We all understand each other, know how to please one another mentally and physically, have unwritten codes, etc.  I don't see men having that, watching them struggle with emotions or social situations...watching them remain completely clueless to how women work, the struggle to understand female anatomy and orgasm gap, libido differences.

We have something similar for times a year when we go out to maintain the road. You talk to people you haven't had a reason to talk to, and some you just plain don't like.   We also started a kinda village get-together for midsummer a while ago. Helps you remember that people are people and not just weirdos who can't keep their damn dogs from barking up a storm every time you walk by and then have the gall to nag you for making the dogs bark by walking by, on the one damn road in the village.
I think the double standard the person is mentioning here is when an individual does not use the same language to describe both men and women. Like I saw a headline recently that had something like "plus-sized women and fat men etc etc". Of course men and women both get insulted on the basis of their weight, but the body-positivity thing has a sharp divide between genders amongst those who promote it.

Europe has a TON of countries on the highest rapes per capita list. Hell of an accomplishment 'mate'. You're right. I think MORE immigrants would definitely solve the issue. Couldn't agree more.  Ooof, the swiss prick misses again! I wasn't saying the Russia or China comment to prove your irrelevance (which your right, it also proves that) but to show the relevance of modern day super powers keeping each other in check.  It has nothing to do with dick size, it has to do with the reality of living in the real world and living near to the 2 superpowers who are land hungry and would eat you up in a second given the absence of comparable military force.

Can't say that I ever had any faith in humanity, and sure the fuck don't at this point in life.  Humans are a virus except that a virus isn't as bad as humans.  A virus only does what is genetically programmed to do.  It didn't have greed, it doesn't have lust, it doesn't change it's behavior on a whim... It only has one purpose and does it well.  And humans have a larger propensity for destruction than a virus.  We're basically just a neurotic, hairless ape with mental illnesses of varying degrees. The planet and the universe would be far better off of we didn't exist.  I used to think that maybe we'd get better but, over the last 50 years we've only gotten worse and more stupid.  Anti-science, anti-vax, flat-earthers, conspiracy theories out the ass, propagated by completely brainless fucks they use entirely too much oxygen.  Racists, sexists, homophobes, and all sorts of hate filled fuckwits that ANY use of oxygen is too much.  The lists of cons of the human race is FAR longer than any possible pros that one could come up with.  If there actually were aliens anywhere close to here, they'd destroy the planet and save themselves because, if we ever actually achieve space travel beyond this solar system, they're fucked

‚Äú11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms ‚Äúnegro,‚Äù ‚Äúoriental,‚Äù ‚Äúhandicapped‚Äù or ‚Äúchick‚Äù for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. ‚ÄúBroad‚Äù and ‚Äúchick‚Äù were merely the feminine equivalents of ‚Äúguy,‚Äù ‚Äúdude‚Äù or ‚Äúfellow.‚Äù The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word ‚Äúpet‚Äù and insist on its replacement by ‚Äúanimal companion.‚Äù Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù by ‚Äúnonliterate.‚Äù They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)‚Äù  Those are the rantings of a conservative incel  Do keep up, yourself

There have been social experiments conducted where they did this. What they found was the negative repercussions to productivity far exceeded any positives. The workers that were paid less became dissatisfied and worked less. The workers that were at the top didn't really work any harder at all and their satisfaction changed much less. HR knows this which is why many companies (illegally) discourage the sharing of salary information with coworkers.

While ML and AI are the new buzzwords that everyone wants to adopt, the reality of ML at the core is basically a scaled up version of statistics and pattern recognition.   This means that training most AI and ML models come with the same issues that most statistical models face which is garbage-in/garbage-out. The key here is that the person who inputs and trains the models has to know what‚Äôs in the data and be able to build around those limitations instead of just chucking the data into the model without considering any factors. This is why Exploratory Data Analysis is now becoming as important as the actual ‚Äúcool‚Äù bits.   In your example, which is a great example of Simpsons Paradox by the way, you can suspect that the final model would have to account for the gender imbalance or even potentially ignore it and consider the multitude of other factors. This is why it‚Äôs important that the person doing the modeling knows what‚Äôs in the data.

I went to a restaurant once and just sat at the bar. I like to do this since i feel like i get better service being able to just say something to the bartender if i need something Well the unpleasant experience was listening to the woman behind me. She was going on and on about her ex-husband and the fact that he was getting remarried soon. She said that she would never get remarried and that "they're gonna pay." referring to her ex husband and his new wife. She kept saying how much money he was worth and that she would not remarry to keep getting alimony. She said she wasn't going to have kids due to her age and that mean that there was no reason to remarry. I'm sure she was probably emotional due to him getting remarried but to listen to someone like that just makes me sick.

Ptsd and night terrors make it real.  Thankfully due to years of therapy I haven't had one in a while, but waking up screaming and crying and drenched in sweat is no joke.  If anything it feels underplayed in most portrayals.  Being suffocated by your fears and being unable to escape your brain and sometimes being unable to move due to sleep paralysis and just being aware of what's coming and not having any control or being able to stop it and just having everything all on you all at one time without any help or anyone to turn to and all your insecurities and fears and traumatic experiences ganging up on you in your weakest moment without any relent or respite is the worst experience of my life aside from the initial trauma.  And that's even an almost even experience.    0 of 10.  Don't recommend.

So.  No correction, no link, no counter argument other than "You used to post to conservative?"  Ever so helpful.  Here.  >This proposal would create a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime. Financial institutions would report data on financial accounts in an information return. The annual return will report gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown for physical cash, transactions with a foreign account, and transfers to and from another account with the same owner. This requirement would apply to **all business and personal accounts** from financial institutions, **including bank, loan, and investment accounts**,2 with the exception of accounts below a low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600. Other accounts with characteristics similar to financial institution accounts will be covered under this information reporting regime. In particular, payment settlement entities would collect Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) and file a revised Form 1099-K expanded to all payee accounts (subject to the same de minimis threshold), reporting not only gross receipts **but also gross purchases, physical cash, as well as payments to and from foreign accounts, and transfer inflows and outflows.** Similar reporting requirements would apply to crypto asset exchanges and custodians. Separately, reporting requirements would apply in cases in which taxpayers buy crypto assets from one broker and then transfer the crypto assets to another broker, and businesses that receive crypto assets in transactions with a fair market value of more than $10,000 would have to report such transactions. >The Secretary would be given broad authority to issue regulations necessary to implement this proposal. The proposal would be effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022.  There ya go, that's the proposal.  Note that this is a proposal that expands Business requirements to Personal accounts.  Doesn't matter if you have a business or not.  Under this regulation, My wife's studio would show a profit.  Which isn't true, because I transfer my personal money into her business account so she can pay rent on the studio.  Am I supposed to create loan paperwork just so these asswipes can go after some kid down the road that makes 1000.00 during the summer cutting grass?  But hey, thanks for being a pain and making me read NOT WHAT MY BANK SENT ME, but what the actual proposal is, which is way, way worse.

I don't think about it
Depends if dumb and dangerous are two separate categories.    Looking back it'd probably be this. Both dumb and extremely dangerous. This will be a claustrophobic story so if that ain't your thing, yeah.   Played around in storm drains a lot (known as a culvert). Really dangerous ones too that had previously drowned a few kids. The tunnels always ran uphill (suburb in the rockies). These large perfectly round tunnels would start out about 6.5 or 7ft tall and then progressively get smaller and smaller the deeper you went. There were small rooms, under the streets and sidewalks we called checkpoints. The rooms under the sidewalk, you could look out through the slit and see cars driving by or hear people walking over your head. The rooms under the street were totally dark aside from the small hole in the manhole and the faint ring shaped glow around the edge of it. Both types of room would have a manhole with a ladder. Under street rooms were approx 3ft tall, sometimes bigger or smaller. Under sidewalk rooms were almost always about 5.5ft tall. Some rooms also had very small (1.5ft tall) holes leading to different rooms, like across the street. Each checkpoint, the tunnel would lose several inches in height. By checkpoint 5 we had to lay belly to the ground and shimmy on our elbows/knees through the pipes (military low crawl), sometimes through thick cobwebs and dead critters that had washed into the tunnel. You couldn't turn around in these small tunnels at all. I promise it was physically impossible. It was either forwards or very slowly and painfully backwards. The tunnels branched off sometimes in three or four directions at once. We'd crawl to each end as far as it went or that we could fit in, then head back to a central point, then carry on. They weren't extremely complex and you just had to remember the way you came which wasn't two hard as we only had to remember a few turns here and there.   Over time we mapped the entire navigable tunnel system out on paper. This was before google maps was really a thing so we didn't know exactly how big it was. Now looking at a map & satellite images I figure it was probably about 2.5 or 3 miles was the furthest we could reach. Most of which was explored crawling in pitch black darkness to save flashlight battery.    We'd go down there to smoke, drink, start small fires, just typical hoodlum nonsense. We even dragged abandoned junk furniture to some of the rooms. When we first explored it, the people who had come before had left plenty of graffiti and messages. By checkpoint 3, almost no messages as it was already very claustrophobic and hard to traverse. You were in a real low crouch and it was easy to scrape your scalp along the top. By 5, there was only one tag who had come before us. In the distant checkpoints like 9-13 there were none but us. This was for a good reason. It's in the name, storm drain. When it rains, they fill. As the water moves downhill, it accelerates. It picks up more water from each rooms. As it hits the top of the tunnels, it gains pressure. Pressure is relieved slightly each time the water hits the next bigger tunnel, but if it rains hard enough, it doesn't matter. On a hard rain, that 7ft tall tunnel entrance is filled to the top and shooting water 30 yards or more into a big double football field sized drainage field. I've seen several ton boulders get pushed away by the water. I've seen that entire field, which is more of a huge bowl if anything, fill up with 15 feet of water in 15 minutes.   When water comes inside the tunnel, it's pretty fucking scary. You hear a tinkle first. Then you feel a tiny drizzle going by your hands. Then your face. Down your chest and legs. The second you feel that water that isn't old standing water, you have to haul ass immediately because it will pull you, pin you inside a checkpoint, drown you, then spit you out miles away if at all. That drizzle means you might already be dead if you're in a bad spot.   There was one occasion I was with my best friend and his yellow lab. We had hit about checkpoint 6 or 7, at least a mile in. We take a break in a checkpoint so we can actually sit upright (I remember this room being about 3ft tall and full of spiderwebs, so we were slumped low to the ground). This was one of the under-street checkpoints, so no light. We couldn't check the weather outside, so we stayed for a short time and moved fast. His dog for whatever reason loved coming with us on our journeys so don't ask. (She crawled right with us happy as could be.) Anyways, we continue our trip to the outer rim of our explored area. This particular section had a very very long crawl between checkpoints. We would go for a hundred yards or more, and stop to take a breather. Then it happened. The drip-drop.     drip-drop.   drip-drop. drip-drop.drip-drop.dripdripdripdripdrip whoooosh SPLASH roar. You always could hear the water before it ever hit you. That was the worst part. The first drips is.. Okay, hopefully that's somebodies sprinklers, some guy washing his car, ya know regular water sources. When you hear drips change into splashing in a matter of 15 seconds... We knew right then we fucked. In the middle of a tunnel, a mile from the entrance. Hundreds of yards into a tunnel away from the checkpoint behind and infront of us. Nobody would hear us if we yelled. I just said to my buddy, man I really fucking hope that's some old guy watering his yard excessively and not a storm. We started crawling, and I mean CRAWLING. Like zombie-no-legs-trying-to-eat-your-brains dragging ourselves along. I have a space so tight that if i lift my head up to look forwards, he head doesn't fit and scrapes the top. So I'm looking flat at the concrete , blowing my air out, huffing and puffing and wiggling/dragging my way as fast as possible like an actual tunnel rat. The baby sized stream started going past and soaked my chest. In the span of 30 seconds we had two inches of water. By a minute, we had about 4 inches, up to my face now. I cock my head to the side like a swimmer and push forward as fast as possible. Even more water. Oh boy it's a bad storm. I can hear my buddy and his dog huffing and puffing right behind me keeping up. Water is still rising. I flip over on my back, put my face up to the top of the tunnel, and am pulling myself through the tunnel with my fingernails along the cracks in-between each section of concrete. Water is pushing and rushing past us, trying to take us down. I can barely get air from the top. As it completely fills and I'm holding my last breath in, right then we burst into the checkpoint, which is a chaotic scene of swirling and sloshing water violently ripping about the place and throwing tons of leaves and garbage against the concrete walls and us. It was smashing us into the walls hard, but we grabbed hold of the ladder. It was another under-street room, about 3ft tall as well. Short enough that it's such a low and awkward squat to get under the manhole it's difficult to lift it up (especially when you're a super underweight kid) but with both of us push while up to our eyes in water, we get it off and onto the street, we look at the dog who was literally chillin in the room paddling smiling and wagging her tail off, we pushed her out first and climbed out. There was an old couple sitting on their porch that witnessed first a nice rain storm. Then a manhole loudly scrape out and onto the street. Then a yellow lab emerge. Followed by two boys lol. They had the most confused look on their face I've ever seen. They said nothing, just watched in shock as we put the manhole back and walked away laughing the adrenaline off.    My clothes were 125% shredded. I was 200% exhausted. We had entered the tunnel that morning and it was evening when we came out. That last sprint drained every bit of life out of me and I looked ghastly pale for hours and damn near collapsed after the adrenaline fully leached out.   We continued going down there for years after that anyways. You meet some weird people in a storm drain.
Eclairs
Not the worst but was definitely awful for a not-well-off family with relatives in another country. We had to purchase a special card to call my grans - a few minutes of crusty-ass phone call for a day's worth of groceries budget. Cherished memories with them wiped because someone exposed the photo tape (whatever it's called) to sunlight.  Now just booting up a video call on whatsapp whenever we want to and sending each other random pics with one flick of a fingertip seems mundane, but when I look back at memories mentioned above I'm like holy shit that was absolutely miserable, let's appreciate the present.
My mum always called us a "fart in a bottle", quite similar.

Nothing about their demeanor after the incident conveyed true remorse.  That was years ago and they may have had a change of heart since but the whole thing just struck me as rotten.
Depends, he might have been blacked out from alcohol.  I assume that he tried it and does remember it, or at least remembers the fact that he tried it, but it's not entirely implausible if you were really wasted on alcohol that you could snort some blow and not remember it.

My personal favorite recipe, might be a little weird for some people though.  Salt and pepper     Cumin     Onion powder     Garlic powder     Chipotle Tabasco     Mayonnaise    Dijon mustard     Chopped green olives      Avocado can substitute for mayo or be added as well, if you happen to have a ripe one when you‚Äôre making the eggs.

In Eminem's Music Box he says "I wonder how come it rains when the sun is out. The devil's upset with his wife, they must be slugging it out."

Does she actually say "black" or does she use another word? Because if someone's using that phrase, there's a good chance they won't censor themselves.

How everytime I go to bed tired, I  always flop around unable to sleep for hours and then finally drifting off, only to get woken up by some telemarketer or family member who has nothing actually important to say but thinks that it's a good idea to wake me up before the sun is even up!
I've been using ATMS since the mid 90's in the UK, and they always "spit" your card out at you (and if you don't take it nothing happens) , and only then do they release the money to you. So you pretty much can't ever forget your card.

Cause the quote is not fully said.   The quote was created by Mr Selfridge. ( I believe )   The actual full quote is ‚ÄúThe customer is always right, in matters of taste.‚Äù Nothing about price, nothing about service, nothing about refunds, just taste. Meaning if a customer wanted a piece of clothing that doesn't suit them in color or fit, Mr. Selfridge would be happy to sell it to him/her‚Äù

It's not difficult to break drywall if you hit it hard. It's a brittle material, but the corners are reinforced with metal strips. I imagine it is because corners are more susceptible to being bumped into plus they are more difficult to repair if they do get damaged. A hole in drywall is pretty simple to fix if you have the materials and a little knowledge.  To answer your question, as to why? I would again have to say because it's the best and cheapest material we have found so far. It's simple to repair, install, and does a good job if you can keep from slamming your fist through it.

The sexualization of children. It's everywhere, and a massive problem, but even mentioning it makes you immediately into a pedo.   Underage celebrities are constantly being paraded around as sex objects. Even the ones who are supposedly against that whole phenomena are hypocrites - Billie Eilish turned 18 and immediately did a lingerie shot in Vogue or whatever.   Our society is fucking *evil* in the way we treat young girls. Seriously. But you're not allowed to talk about it, because only perverts even think about that stuff. Even if it's blatant and everywhere.

ThE vAgInA iS aCtUaLlY iNsIdE tHe BoDy So ThAt WoUlD bE iMpOsSiBlE  Yeah yeah ok, getting past that very helpful comment...  The women I've asked have all said it's pretty painful. There's a lot of nerves there and only bone behind it - which is itself pretty painful to hit (think shins). The difference though is the pain is entirely localised, like it would be if you were punched in the arm or stubbed your toe. Obviously with us guys the pain quickly travels to the abdomen and stomach area and feels absolutely horrendous, apparently that's unique to us.
That doesn't change what I said at all. Don't hang out with criminals.
Cruising for a bruising - it means if you carry on doing something that you shouldn't be, the person will beat you up. Bruise you.   Example - You poke me, I tell you not to. You do it again, I tell you not to again. You do it a third time, I'll say "you're cruising for a bruising!" meaning if you continue poking me, I'll get aggressive.

I‚Äôm late to the party here but there have been massive energy shortages in China recently causing the government to cut certain production facilities down to 30% capacity. Part of this is due to a shortage in the work force, but I think it‚Äôs part of a larger energy crisis in China.   I hope I‚Äôm wrong I think we are approaching an energy crisis that could be a major issue.

I used to, and still do sometimes, say it to my kid. No actual bruising ever took place. It's my way of warning that he is close to getting in trouble.  I say the phrase and then give him one more warning which drives him crazy because it makes no sense, "you're gellin for a kellen".  He will either roll his eyes or laugh, but the behavior stops.  I also warn him with  "I am going to take away your birthday ".  One day when he was six he replied with "please don't kill me mom!'"... I  was surprised and dismayed that I never picked up on what it meant as I meant it as, no birthday with presents.   For the record, these things were always said humorously and he was made aware no actual bruising or killing would ever take place.
Leave me out of the coyotes.

Hmm this is an interesting one. You do have a point - I‚Äôll give you that. But imo why I disagree with this comparison, is that there‚Äôs a high level of social responsibility associated with vaccines.  It‚Äôs similar to antibiotics - where if everyone started taking them when not needed, we would grossly accelerate the evolution of superbugs. This threatens our society‚Äôs ability to use life-saving antibiotics in the future. There‚Äôs a global responsibility here.  Similarly, with the vaccine, if you‚Äôre able-bodied and refuse to take a well-tested vaccine because a few people had severe immune reactions (which carries a 10x stronger risk with the virus itself btw), you are part of the group of people putting society as a whole at risk. Particularly those who can‚Äôt take the vaccine due to known allergic reactions. It goes way beyond one pre-human ‚Äòlife‚Äô.  Plus, while some scientists think on the contrary, there are growing concerns that incomplete take-up of the vaccines may lead to a superbug situation similar to the antibiotics scenario

Hah. There are those who say that adult women could not give consent to a slightly popular (at the time) comedian who asked permission to spank off in front of them because supposedly he held a tiny amount of sway in the comedy circuit.

You wanna know whats true evil? Your name has now been burned into my brain, everytime i will take a piss i will have a mental image of a woman stealing and  drinking my piss. I will eventually die from a kidney stone because i will never be able to piss again. Are you happy? Is this enjoyable? If yes then THAT is true evil

I'm not minimising that, but to claim it's only the problem of one group is precisely the kind of thinking that leads to the topic of this thread.
Sat behind them in class, heard them blaring music in their headphones I liked. Waited a few weeks and eventually asked them if it was the band I thought it was. It was and she started sitting next to me after. Months of friendship later and we went to a fair and awkwardly walked around for a few hours.   Didn't think I'd get a second date, but a week later she asked if she could come over. I said yes, we watched netflix for an hour then fucked. Then we made it official right after.  &#x200B;  Truly a love story of the generation. But it worked out well in the end, we are coming up on our 2 year anniversary.

I didn't plan before and I'm not planning after this, but I don't even meet with people more than once a week, and that is with the cashier, behind two masks, desinfectants and a glass panel(I doubt that it's doing anything practical, since the masks already stop the sneezes.).  So far, many acquaintances got infected, and the ones with vaccines found out rather late, which caused them to infect others, ironically.  Everyone has an opinion, that's mine.

Not OP, but I grew up in New York State. Until the late 1980s, the pulling your eyes thing when referring to Asian people was common everywhere. I heard the loose sphincter thing during this time as well.   I now live in rural Nebraska. In 2010, I was working as a teacher's aide in the local school district. The history teacher told the class that the best and most inspiring job a woman can have is being a wife and a mother. I fucking cringed.  In 2015, my British mother-in-law told me "I knew a colored lady once. She was a lawyer. She did real good for herself." I left the room and let my husband deal with her. A few days later, my sister-in-law said the tailor had messed up fixing her pants but that, "the business is owned by coloreds so what can you expect?" I turned to my husband and asked him how he turned out normal. He said he spent a lot of time watching the news and reading newspapers at the library as a kid.
yeah I believe there are lots of good women, I have some really good friends but opening up to them too much made them change their behavior and lose interest in me even as a friend

Probably the way democracy works in the US vs some other countries. In the Netherlands for example it's relatively easy to start a political party and we don't have constituencies where only the biggest party gets a seat in the house of representatives or senate for example. If 10% of the people (evenly spread out across every town/city) vote for a political party then they will get 10% of the seats. Because of that we have a sh\*tton of parties, we don't have to pick the lesser of 2-4 evils and parties or companies can't push a politician as much. If you screw up you'll get less votes and are in trouble (we have some parties who over 70% of their seats over the last 10 years). A good politician can survive for decades but if you screw up you are out.

The military spending is a funky deal. If we reduce military spending, we essentially weaken NATO. The NATO agreement is 2% of your GDP spent on military, and we‚Äôre at about 4%, but there‚Äôs around 30 countries in NATO, and only about 8 maintain their militaries the way they agreed to. NATO sole purpose is to deter countries like Russia from pulling some Crimea shit on the group, or China doing a South China Sea/Hong Kong/Taiwan.   I really believe that if the other other countries stepped up, we could reduce it. Sadly, without them pulling their own weight, and countries that are proving themselves to be hostile dicks, we can‚Äôt without putting the world at risk.
When I was in 7th grade, I was reading a book during recess. Minding my own business, not cause any issues. Well, that didn't stop this one kid from smashing a brick in the back of my head.   I ended up in the hospital for weeks recovering from that. Yet when it was time for me to go back to school, not only was the kid still there but I was put into detention for 'causing a ruckus in the schoolyard'. I was written up and put in detention for 2 months for getting hit in the head with a brick. But the other kid? Not even a day.  Zero Tolerance doesn't work. If it did, our positions after the event would have been reversed.   'He only did that because he likes you' Yes, nothing says 'I like you' better than potential brain damage.

>"If only we could get rid of all those Trump voters this country would be paradise". The irony of your position is lost on you.  Who you quoting there? Are you... making up my position by putting words in my mouth? So your strategy here is to build a strawman, pretend I built it, and then cut it down in order to come out on top of a disagreement? Cool.  >No such thing as left wing violence of course.  You must also be one of those people that can't understand that even though women rapists exist, that most rapes are caused by men. The vast majority of rapes are caused by men. So you won't entertain a conversation about addressing the issue of men raping men and men raping women. "No such thing as women raping of course."  Again, you're part of the problem. You can't be honest about what is going on, and you get lost in a slow tangle of whataboutism instead of making time to problem solve actual issues.

My granny when she was a kid saw the body of a young kid who'd been run over. Her dad went out and covered the body with a sheet. Another time a girl was holding on to the back of a truck or something on a skateboard. The Skateboard fell and the girl was dragged along the road wearing a skirt. All her skin along the legs and knees were torn off.   She also saw a dead body at the bottom of the street when she was young. It was a man killed by the IRA as they thought he was an informer. My father as a kid also saw a hand amongst the rubble of a building a bomb had blown up. Also a man who'd been tortured to death was dumped outside his back garden. Northern Ireland was a crazy place during the Troubles

None of the above but I had to call a computer expert when I got a virus on my computer.  To this day I don't know how I ended up with it but basically  the virus was filling my computer's memory with porn.  Of the worst kind.  Truly sick stuff including child porn - the guy showed me a few snippets of videos as he explained what the virus was doing.  I told him he could destroy the computer if he wanted as I didn't want any of that anywhere near me but he managed to fix it.  I never felt comfortable with the computer after that and when I needed a new one a few years later I took a sledgehammer to it.

I wanna preface this with I've never ever had sex before in my life. When I was a teenager I got warts all over my hands and they wouldn't go away until a little after high school. Somehow during the time I had them they spread to my genitals but they too went away just like the ones on my hands. Every time my immune system goes down now I get a wart somewhere on my body whether it be on my dick or on my hands but somewhere one pops up. They usually go away on their own after a month or two but it's really really damaged me mentally and I'm scared to even have the slightest sexual encounter with a woman. I don't want to pass this on to a woman because I know it can mean cancer from HPV for them whereas guys it's more just cosmetically not attractive and doesn't really cause many problems. I'm scared to even touch or kiss a girl even though I like her because I don't wanna curse her with this shit and hurt her. It's damaged me a lot especially the fact that I didn't even contract it sexually. I had never ever had a sexual experience before when I first got the warts. I've had one or two since but I was extremely careful and there was absolutely no penetration whatsoever.

One night while I was Lying on my back, I couldn‚Äôt move, and I saw a figure looking over me in the corner, and an even closer figure looking at me through the window that goes onto the ward. I was petrified. I thought ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs just one of the staff‚Äù. I checked with the nurses, doctors, etc and they said they only checked up on me every few hours and the time I estimated they weren‚Äôt there.

Are you a Person of color? Because otherwise you're just engaging in dog whistle racism and quoting conservative pundits right now man. In colorado in particular, a bill was passed that would lead to prosecution for any officer who tampers with evidence, who fails to activate audio and video recording on body cams and dash cams when initiating contact with a suspect, and holds police to a higher standard than the general public, and those all occurred on conjuction with BLM and justice reform protests. So honestly man, you should really just listen to what People of color want, and not blame an organization that has, like many political movements, been mischaracterized by many media outlets, and been hijacked by extremists, because at a certain point people get tired of being told no. If you don't believe in systemic racism, please Google the first law enforcement agencies to exist in the country, because they were Marshalls tasked with catching runaway slaves.

My family and I were on the coast of southern Sri Lanka when the tsunami of 2006 happened. I am an avid swimmer and was in the water every morning before but not that day. According to my aunt, we got into our taxi van and left about 10min before the Tsunami came in - we stopped in town and checked out our driver‚Äôs house, the 1950's car his dad saved money to buy to become a taxi driver and provide for his family. Then headed inland to the elephants and tea plantations.  The radio cut out and eventually the driver found another station, then that cut out, and the next few stations were nothing but news (spoken in local language) and we couldn't understand.  Then the driver tried explaining to us that a river overflowed and there was a lot of damage... but he was explaining what the news was saying. It got more and more chaotic after that because NONE OF THE LOCALS knew what a tsunami was, so no one could explain or comprehend the situation.  100's of miles of coastline, gone.  All the places I had visited 3 days ago, gone. My drivers house, car, everything, gone. I travel with a hand-held world radio so once I fished that out of my bag, we found an English news station and that's when it got real.  That night we listened to the news updates and the body count just kept going up and up and up.  We were lucky.  When we eventually made it to the airport, we saw a total mess. So many injured, nowhere to go, flights all booked, cancelled, and just so many people.  My brother suffered PTSD from processing all of the devastation we had avoided... survivors guilt they call it.  It messed me up too as it's very hard to write this but cathartic at the same time.  Thanks for allowing me to share.

The overall pink and purple dominance is disappointing but the sets are interesting. Overall I like the greater range of color selection in their products, just ticks me off that the "girl" sets use pink/purple/teal so heavily  Changing the look of the minifigs was pointless. Some comic did a bit about making LEGO for girls and the woman on the team points out you can just put a ponytail hair on the minifig. Not all girls have to have lipstick and lashes.
I was 18 when I graduated high school so I got to sign out to myself my own "permanence record".  Whilst some of it was interesting, none of it ended up permanent.

I met someone with prosopagnosia.  It was really interesting to hear how about how he navigated the world. He moved to a itty bitty teenie tiny town in West Texas so he would literally know everyone in town and identifies people by their bodies/hair.  He said it really fucks him up when his friends get haircuts!

What a terrible way to go.
I live in Baltimore.  You either keep your head on a swivel, walk in the middle of the street if possible, or don't.   I didn't have a vehicle over 20 yrs ago and had to catch a bus to work early AM.  I was shot one morning standing on a bus stop and then running from an attempted armed robbery.  Ended up only going through my leg just below my knee, missed bone but took out an artery and nerves.  I was fortunate, could have been a lot worse but still deal with pain and numbness in that leg.  I drive now and have at odd ball hours as a courier for the last 18 years.  That's a whole different issue.  In this city especially, keep your eyes open for car jackers.  Fortunately, I live in the county outside of the city and most of my drives are long distance highway stuff.  I really have no reason to go downtown much less walk down there at night.  Just be careful man and always know what is going on around you.

Maybe it's a saturation thing?  Like, I acknowledge that The Eagles are a good band but if I ever have to sit and listen to Hotel California all the way through ever again, I might just black out and kill someone or something.  I've been on this earth for nearly 40 years, and for every single one of them, that song has popped up on the radio daily.  I was probably sick of that song before I could even walk, and yet to this very day I can't skip through the radio stations without hearing it.

I was diagnosed with Grave‚Äôs disease as well. It was absolutely insane. Losing my mind was the most uncomfortable thing I ever went through. It slowly got worst and worst and worst.  Is it a thyroid cancer? My scans came back and the nodes shrunk with the medicine, so not cancerous in my case.  This was a blessing in disguise, I used to be a fond believer of mind over matter and that people don‚Äôt need medicine for mental health. But then life slapped me across the face and made me realize that some people really do need medication because of some chemical imbalance. Definitely an advocate for mental health awareness, and thyroid disease.

I'll break from the trend of talking about exes  My old job  Right before covid hit, I got a job through a temp agency working at a rite aid distribution warehouse. It was backbreaking work, but it put a little cash in my bank account and that was good enough for me because I was desperate. I ended up not being retained for a permanent position, but it was actually a good thing. I was working in winter. I found out that the summer that followed brought along some issues that I thankfully wasn't there to deal with. See, I love in the Mojave desert, where during some of the hotter months it's odd to see a daily high temperature of below 100 degrees. Apperently, the warehouse doesn't have FUCKING air conditioning. I shit you not it's just a few fans here and there to cool the employees off. Evidently my old warehouse and a few others throughout the region had multiple people fall ill due to heat exhaustion, and one person actually needed medical attention and IV fluids.  TLDR: was sad over losing a job, now happy that I did because they have inhumane working conditions that I only recently became aware of.

I haven't really had any physical affection since I was a kid, other than the occasional familial hug, no relationships to speak of. Then at one point my manager's girlfriend put her arm around me platonically, and it just skeeved me the fuck out. Like, I literally recoiled because my physical reaction (nothing inappropriate, more of a fight or flight type of response) was just so intense that it was uncomfortable.  She thought it was funny, and chased me around a bit trying to give me a hug after that. That was around 10 years ago, I can't even imagine how I'd react now if someone I was interested in tried to touch or hug me.
No, if you keep your attention on driving, it will not happen. It happens only one of two ways: deliberately, or if you aren't paying attention to driving while behind the wheel. Neither are in any way acceptable or inevitable.

On a rainy and windy night, I parked in my usual spot. Got out of the car and looked up at the hundreds of feet tall redwood trees swaying in the wind. They had stood there forever, certainly through storms far worse than this.  Something told me to move my car, and I listened to it. I literally just moved it to the other side of the street and parked it. As I got out of the car, a massive 40 foot section of one of the trees cracked off and crashed to the ground right where I had been parked. I felt the ground shake. I‚Äôll never forget it.  Listen to that little voice inside your head.

I kinda skirted under the rules because I was "just a tech" and got to run basically all our experiments for over 4mo.

There's *so* much more nuance than a lot of people (generally) know or understand.     The quick overview -    Until maybe late 50s, Deaf schools were treated much like asylums (in the US). It was very much about trying to integrate via lip reading, oral schools, and denial of *self* by "ignoring" the Deafness.     Deaf clubs and other communal spaces were one of the sole sources of any kind of community/culture - there's deaf folks in their 40s and 50s that know about *so and so,* where they graduated, what school they went to, etc., because of how close knit the community *can* be. (Restricting myself from saying *is,* as any larger group will tend to ostracize *someone,* intentionally or not.)     The language and culture started making more headway as video products, closed captioning, and ADA introductions provided equitable access.     Fast forward 30 years, and cochlear implants came out. It was a big 'go-to' for parents who could afford it, both hearing and deaf, but they are by no means a 'cure.' There are times you *can't* wear it (i.e. swimming). And the individual is essentially brought into the same patterns as yesteryear: let's ignore that you're deaf, and educate you to be as close to hearing as possible, but without the added benefit of culture/language.     The concerns about feeling some level of erasure is *huge*, as many (d)eaf did not have very supportive families. I've met Deaf folks who were the firstborn, and their parents *and* siblings never bothered to learn an inkling of ASL.  So families that opt for cochlear implants may unintentionally be seeing their child as *only* hearing, and forget the whole other 'half.'  &#x200B;  I know what I'd want for any kid I had, but I also wouldn't want to force them into feeling they *had* to be "hearing" or "deaf" and really try to encourage them to grow into either aspect, but with lots of additional education (i.e. ASL studies, Deaf events, etc.).

I absolutely LOVE the sound of heavy auto tune in music. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize that even artists who use it heavily are typically great singers without it (e.g. T-Pain). It takes a lot of practice to give auto tuned that hypnotic robotic sound you hear from artists who use it heavily. It‚Äôs an aesthetic and it‚Äôs fully intentional. Most people are unaware of this and think artists who use auto tune must be SO bad at singing that they get a computer to do the work for them. It‚Äôs similar to a model wearing blue eyeshadow. She‚Äôs obviously not trying to convince you that her eyebrows are actually blue, she‚Äôs simply using it for the EFFECT it creates, just like artists who use heavy auto tune.
Alpha radiation is absorbed in air after traveling ~20 cm.  Beta radiation has a bit bigger penetration, it can damage your skin and cause some burns.  Gamma can travel from the Sun to you, its penetration is high and strong. Damages DNA, causes cancer, kills people, etc. This is the type of radiation that killed many people in and around Chernobyl, Hiroshima and Nagasaki and caused much more people to have cancer and other diseases.

Murphy Brown is another big example of that. It was one of the biggest shows on TV in the early 90s. It was on for 11 seasons. The first 7 seasons averaged over 15 million viewers per episode. It was the kind of thing where The Simpsons would reference it and just expect the audience to know exactly what was being referenced like when they did bits about The Godfather. Nowadays I doubt many people under 25 even know what Murphy Brown is.

At-will employment is an artifact of a country with a rich history of actual slavery.  *In theory* the at-will street runs both ways, and an employee is as free to go get another job without notice as their employer is to fire them without notice.  Of course, *in practice* employers have the vast majority of the leverage, since most workers are viewed as easily replaceable and, as noted above, most workers have needs for things like medical insurance through work which are not easily replaced (and even if you can find a new job tomorrow, your insurance may not kick in immediately).  Having said that, at-will employment is a good deal more complex than the summary "your employer can fire you at any time for any reason or no reason" might suggest.  As a practical matter, most employers don't simply fire their employees without cause, and some have self-imposed policies and procedures.  Those usually explicitly do not trump the at-will nature of the employment, but failure to follow them when they are applicable raises questions.   Likewise, most employees fall into one or more classes protected against discrimination by law, and in my experience, most employees who are likely to get fired can point to one or more incidents that they claim demonstrate discrimination or retaliation and on which a lawsuit may be based.  How successful such a claim is likely be varies widely (largely on location), but if it clears the first hurdle a discrimination suit is likely to cost at least tens of thousands of dollars in defense costs.  So firings are not *entirely* free.
Honestly?  I'd be a bit disappointed and I would let them know that.  AFTER I let them know that they're still my child and I love them no matter what.  Why would I be disappointed? Because I'd had gay friends before and I know how much more difficult life can be for them simply for being attracted to the same sex.

These are too common ones!  I don‚Äôt know if they ever go away but I have def been able to cut them down by saying ‚Äòno‚Äô or ‚Äòstop‚Äô like I said above. For me it definitely helps when it‚Äôs outloud. So I few times a week I‚Äôll say/think ‚Äúugh I wish I was dead‚Äù and usually by ‚Äòwish‚Äô now I‚Äôll say outloud ‚Äúno you dont‚Äù or stop.   But also when I said talk to the voice like it‚Äôs a kid I meant that literally!  If I forgot to send an important email and that whole spiral starts and gets to self-harm super quickly I‚Äôd say to myself.   ‚ÄúYou forgot the email. You can deal with the consequences. You‚Äôve done it before. You‚Äôre alright. Nothing terrible has happened. You‚Äôre okay. You can send it in a few minutes with an apology. If they are upset with you that won‚Äôt kill you. You‚Äôll just take responsibility and it‚Äôll be fine‚Äù.   That helps isolate it to one incident with a solution and not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a loser and I‚Äôm probably going to get fired and everyone would be better off without me‚Äù self-talk.   I know one guy on tik tok who teaches this and he‚Äôll call himself ‚Äòdarling‚Äô or ‚Äòmy love‚Äô and that‚Äôs just not authentic to me but it really helped me understand the exercise.   Be gentle with yourself!

I lived (and still do) 0.5 miles away from Pulse and was home that night. I remember hearing the sounds of that gun firing and being so confused/concerned. My  roommates and I rationalized the noise as some late night I-4 construction. We woke up to the news of what had actually transpired and were absolutely gutted. I drive past Pulse (yes, it's still there. It's a memorial now with 24/7 security) almost every day. I'm glad your family friend wasn't there. Crazy that the McDonald's they went to is still sooo close. \~0.5 miles.
Actually, sleep deprivation is the _only_ time that I can reliably experience hallucinations.

It's all just perceptual errors.

I ended saying no way and going to the other street to listen from there. 3...2...1... mini earthquake and I go back around to the street to see all of them with shrapnel in their legs and arms. 2 of my friends needed surgery and lost alot of blood.

1) I do not believe my opinion is fact. I reserve the right to hold my opinion though.  2) Gender and sex are two different things. People born with XX chromosomes but all male attributes. For the vast majority of the world - 99% plus - we fall into two categories. Biological male XY and biological female XX. Why upend the whole way we speak and think to satisfy the outliers? Why to they get mad and demand we do?  Never anywhere in this entire string do I say anyone does not have a right to exist. Where do you get that in anything I said?

I have had a girl I used to work with attempt to cancel me. She went to the director of staffing, which is about 3 people over my boss to report that I was inappropriately talking with a client. The client just lost her mother and sister on the same day and I was applying my sense of humor to lighten the mood, which it did tremendously. I almost got fired, but the woman I was accused of being inappropriate with left a hand written review a week later mentioning how supportive and helpful I was specifically and how I was an angel sent from heaven to help her through this hard time.

Right after my collision I read about some murderous a**holes who had poured oil on the road and strung across some steel wire to kill motorcyclists.  Even the best gear can‚Äôt avoid the crazies that already are out there!  Anyway, good luck to you and may the rubber side always be on the road for you!

your opinion is wrong
let alone the fact that YOU were the first one to "not let someone have an opinion"  &#x200B;  How is just saying "death proof and django are great" contributing to the conversation when you disagree with it? I was asked for examples and I gave them, just saying you liked them doesn't add anything to the conversation after that. If it was really about letting people have their opinions you would've stopped replying right there.

Had I gone per schedule, I probably would've been burned alive or stabbed to death.

Not OP, but someone who had a similar situation - except I did wind up marrying the person ... not a great move in hindsight.  Anyway, after my ex abducted the kids and accused me of plotting her murder she refused to communicate via anything but FB chat.  Which actually turned out to be great because any time she'd start going off on my having not given her correct information or said this instead of that - I could just scroll back and see _exactly_ what had been said, and generally find out that I was remembering things correctly, she'd just screwed up and immediately started blaming me.  During the ensuing court case this came in handy as well.  She tried to force me to pay her legal fees because I "refused to negotiate and forced her to hire a lawyer".  I just went back in the chats where the very first mention of lawyers by either of us was her flat out telling me "You should hire a lawyer".

"Oh no everyone does it when they're drunk! And Tom only had 2 drinks, he was perfectly fine to drive"  I fucking hate alcohol and it's social normality. People do dumb shit drunk all the time and most of the time it's illegal but there's a social pass to the illegal shit they do because drunk.   Jumping off roofs into pools, you wouldn't do that sober and the home owner 100% definitely does not ever fucking want that to happen if they are sober because they are liable for damages to property and the medical bill when they eventually hurt themselves. But when they're drunk? Go for it.  Fucking hate that drug. It's so addicting that it's legal and people just don't realize that.
Yup and somehow it always gets flipped back on you like you‚Äôre shaming the people drinking and that‚Äôs fucked up. Just from declining alcohol lol

When I was 8 yrs old me and my mom we're living in a shelter with other single mothers. I would usually play my Wii on the weekends cs that's when all the parents would either be sleep or at work. But there was this one girl (who imma name Sierra) that wanted to play with me. She had a huge butt and big tits so I was mostly attracted to her. She was Abt two  or three yrs older than me but we still would play on the game and just chill in the living room of the shelter. But one day she was sitting in the rocket chair that I would usually sit in so when she went to go use the bathroom I had sat in it. Mins later she came back and demanded her sit back but I wasn't gonna get up but then she just sat on top of me. Mind you I was 8 so I wasn't really sexually attracted to her bc I didn't realized what was happening but eventually we ended up having sex. the thing is tho is that it happened around 5 or 6 times every month. Up until 3 months later she and her mother moved to a house. At the time I didn't really think nothing was wrong but as I got older I start to realize what happened to me and now idk how to live with myself.

Toxic monogamy. Insisting your partner should see you as their everything, their best friend, their sexual partner, financial advisor, maid, adventure buddy, personal chef, and nanny, but then resenting all the pressure they put on you. This combined with the pressure for the relationship escalator to progress (start dating, kiss, say I love you, get serious, get engaged, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc) makes a lot of relationships feel like failures just because inappropriate expectations are put on them. All of this also puts so much othering onto folks who do things differently, even though they're just living their best life.

My husband and I were on a weekend break in Glasgow. Did the classic tourist thing of doing a hop on hop off bus tour. On the tour we saw this pub that we thought could be a good shout for drinks that evening and I made a note of its name - The Clutha. We ended up going instead to a fantastic Indian restaurant (haggis pakora were top notch) and then went back to our hotel. In the morning woke to the news that a helicopter had crashed into that pub. The three in the helicopter and seven patrons at the bar died due to the incident.

I got told more than a few times that people would kill me for the stupidest shit.  Absolutely no way that I would resort to violence unless I needed to because I felt my life or someone's might be at risk.     After that day, when you hit them, did they continue to bully you?  Did others around you regard you any differently?

I think being possessive is something that everyone really likes it but it is only good if you have only kept it to your self. Showing possessive nature doesn't mean love. It's kind of toxic behavior that is socially acceptable because people do think that he/she loves you thats why they are possesive of you. But it does drain out the other person and change their perspective.

Brandon Belt (baseball player) did, but mockingly.

I lived in this one apartment for a couple years (not sure exactly how long). Really liked the place, it took me forever to find it and it saved me from my old place which was a total dump. Then, pretty spontaneously, I decided to move across the country for family reasons. Had to leave some furniture I loved behind. A few months later, the place burned down because of a fire the downstairs neighbors accidentally started. My former roommate and all of his pets (and everyone else in the house) were thankfully ok, but most of the furniture was trashed.

I don‚Äôt see any path to happiness in my life. All I‚Äôve known is struggle and misery and every time I get a leg up in life disaster sends me to a new low I didn‚Äôt even think possible. I‚Äôve always tried to be positive, always tried to push through, to work my ass off to get to something better, tried therapy, but I see no point anymore. I‚Äôm in my 30s with severe health problems that have nearly killed me multiple times, so my life most likely won‚Äôt be much longer. I‚Äôm already out of time basically and I‚Äôve never gotten anywhere. I will always be in poverty, always on the brink of homelessness,always be suffering with health issues I can‚Äôt afford to take care of. Never be able to transition, never feel safe coming out. Never afford a house, never have a family of my own. Never leave my shitty city I hate. The world is on fire and no one who can do anything about it seems to give a shit. Politics keep getting more heated. Natural disasters and mass shootings keep increasing. I‚Äôve had so many traumatizing experiences and seen so many horrific things I can‚Äôt keep track anymore. Death, dismemberment, suicide, domestic violence, etc. over and over and over again in my life. I used to joke about it but, I honestly wake up every day now and have an existential crisis wondering if I‚Äôm dead and this is all some cruel hell that I deserve for past mistakes. Maybe I died one of those times I was on an operating table? Or maybe in one of those car crashes? Maybe I never woke up from one of the many times I had a stabbing pain in my chest and promptly fainted? Maybe this is all gods punishment because I lost my faith? Or because I‚Äôve committed some unforgivable sin? Who knows? I just don‚Äôt know why I wake up or do anything anymore beyond being terrified of death and feeling responsible to take care of those around me. But lately, I feel more like a burden to people than a help. Anyways, no one cares and I don‚Äôt expect anyone to. It‚Äôs all pointless anyways. I‚Äôll go back to bottling it up and carrying on.But thanks for the chance to vent OP.

The fact that the GOP is apparently not able to kick Donald Trump in the teeth.
I was at Oktoberfest, in Munich, way back in 2005. I was there with a guy I grew up with who had moved to Germany for work, and all of his European friends that he had made since he had been there. We had been partying at O-Fest since 9:00am, and we had drank just about enough of beer for the day, when I noticed some dude at our table was rolling a "marijuana cigarette". My German sucks, so I didn't say a word, but one of the Finns we were there with opened right up and asked the dude if he had enough to share. At that point, I got up to go to the bathroom and when I returned to our table everyone I was with wanted to head to the train station and get home to bed. On the way to the train station, the Finnish kid in our group put his arm around me and told me that he got some weed from the dude at our table, but he didn't need it because he had some at home anyway. So he took the weed out of his pocket and stuck it in my back pocket as we stumbled toward the entrance to the train station. The moment our group got to the bottom of the stairs leading to the trains there were six Polizei (German Police) waiting armed with submachine guns. They grabbed my friend and the Finnish kid, and very roughly threw them against a nearby wall and started rifling through their pockets asking them "where the drugs were". I stood there frozen, waiting for them to notice I was part of that particular group and search me too, but out of nowhere, the Finns' girlfriend grabbed me by the hand and said "C'mon sweetheart, let's go home" (in German ofcourse), and we boarded the train while my friend and her boyfriend were tossed by the cops. Obviously, the cops found no contraband, because it was in my pocket, so they let my pals go who then boarded the train white as ghosts from what had just transpired. As the train departed the station, my two pals were ranting and raving about how illegal weed is in Germany and how much trouble they would have got in if I wasn't the one smuggling the drugs in my pocket. I thanked the Finnish guys' girlfriend for saving my ass, and when we got back to my pals' flat where I was staying, I rolled that shit into the most rewarding joint I have ever smoked.

> If the whole world went vegan, then what would be done about cows? Do you think they‚Äôd magically disappear or something?  The whole world isn‚Äôt going vegan overnight, just as the whole world isn‚Äôt giving up coal overnight. Neither are feasible or realistic.  If progressively more and more people go vegan, then fewer and fewer cows will be bred into existence due to a declining demand in cow consumption. Eventually if you get to the point of the entire world going vegan, this leads you to where no cows are being artificially inseminated/bred by humans into existence.
2 winters ago my dad and I were heading to pick up a pizza for dinner. We were at a red light by our house turning left. The light turns green and my dad doesn't move, I almost spoke up to tell him " It's green " thinking he was distracted by something out his window when a HUGE snow plow went through the red light. Not a city street snow plow - but a heavy duty highway snow plow. Very scary encounter and now I keep my distance from them in the winter.

I was offered a promotion at one of our satellite sites on the other side of the country.  Great opportunity.  Decided to wait 12 months as I didn't feel financially ready to be able to uproot my whole family. They agreed and at my next annual review we'd start the process.  6 months later, everyone at that site was laid off due to budget cuts.  I would have been stuck with no job on the other side of the country with no safety net.

Happened with my mom and her friend during the 2006 Mumbai train blasts.   My mom is a school teacher and on that day she and her friend were about to board a train to come back home, but another friend of theirs was struck in traffic. My mom's friend suggested that they wait for her to arrive, which she agreed to.  That train exploded on the very next station.    (For those who know Mumbai, my mom and her friend were standing on Andheri Station and the bomb exploded at the Jogeshwari station)

Florida just has a lot going on. Just take the sheer size of it for example. It would take someone following the speed limit laws 13.5 hours to drive from Pensacola all the way to Key West. For reference, I can drive from Tallahassee to Washington, DC in 12 hours. Just the sheer spread of the state means you get a little bit of everything mixed in.

My ex-wife befriended a convicted pedophile (who was barred from owning anything connectible to the internet due to his online behavior with minors), bought him a new iphone under her name with cash, and acquired a gun to use on me when I came home from work one day, so she could freely move her new bestie into what would be the former marital home. She was cocky and dumb enough to brag to another friend/co-worker of hers what she was planning to do, and they notified me so I could get the law involved. After I swiftly moved away to a secure location, she moved her new friend into the home immediately, & they didn't realize that I (an IT technician & aspiring homelab-er) could still access my custom router, ip security cameras outside the home & firewall for the internet connection...so I sent law enforcement logs and video of her bragging to her family what she was doing, & what her new friend was up to on the internet connection I was still paying for until the end of the month. Divorce was immediate and very financially advantageous for myself!

I would LOVE to know how my weird neighbor that lives below me manages to have his tv set up to where I could hear his tv playing through my floor. And not just a little, it was louder than my tv. Floor stomping finally gave him a hint ( I had a migraine and idk)  but I can still hear his zoom calls dialing in. Wtf kind of set up do you have going on?? Are your speakers screwed to the ceiling? Is your computer plugged into surround sound??  I can't wait to move. I do love the maintenance man though.

If I had to, I have two siblings I would trust just because they a) have made really good life choices and fiscal decisions and b) I go to them for money advice.  I would not let my SO manage my money - learned the hard way that SO can‚Äôt manage their own finances.  I manage the big stuff and it sucks knowing that they don‚Äôt care about saving or planning ahead.  I think the key to any money management is: don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.  Some people talk a great game but then when you watch them, they aren‚Äôt what they say they are.  You use some different funds to throw your money into - some fund plans will do better than others.  But if one fund has a bad manager, it means they didn‚Äôt have all of your money.

Hate to be a downer but I REALLY hate the concept that cancer is a fight you win, especially with kids.  Its bad enough to lose someone to cancer, then you have to hear survivors being complimented on their "strength", "tenacity", etc.    I know it comes from a good place, but it's never not painful and I think there's a better way to celebrate life without hurting the ones left behind.

I think, even though it sounds more like rhetoric or a caricature at first blush, there really is philosophical weight to the claim that "Being a billionaire is an ethical failing." We look at that amount of wealth and instinctively recognize that something is wrong; that no one person can just do that on their own, yet they somehow acquired all of this wealth that other people created.  But, on the flipside, many people love a success story, and look up to specific individuals who are the movers-and-shakers of the day. Bezos is the person associated with bringing us long-tail 2-day delivery. Musk is the flamboyant industrialist of our day, like Carnegie and Rockefeller in the past.

I interviewed for this job that I desperately wanted.  Company was REALLY cool, exec I interviewed with had a great vision for the company, the office was really close to my house and the pay was phenomenal.  I ended up not getting the job as the CEO swept in at the last minute and brought in a friend of his.  6 weeks later the company folded.  CEO and CFO were into some shady financial dealings that came to light and tanked the entire company out of the blue.

Personally I think *both* sides are bat shit insane. Democrats just do a better job at pretending to care about people though, so they win more people over. Unfortunately they are all just puppets, and they do some of the same things republicans do, one example is getting the rich richer. They also are undermining American democracy, I guess that‚Äôs hard to see for some people though.   We are slowly morphing into a mix of Fascism/Authoritarianism. Been slowly happening forever but kicked into high gear when Trump got into office, and isn‚Äôt getting better with Biden. The money trail doesn‚Äôt lie, and all of it leads back to the same puppeteers, sadly.

I was interviewing for a job and the interviewer had a flight delay and couldn‚Äôt make it, I was told, but honestly I just felt they forgot about it. I got a bad vibe about the whole situation and refused to reinterview.   A few months later my would be boss was charged for dereliction of duty by regulators and lost their professional license, if I worked for them I likely would be subject to those actions as well, potentially rendering me unable to work in my field.

Very clever cherry picking certain parts of my argument to address, while ignoring others that don‚Äôt fit your narrative.  However, since you ARE young, I won‚Äôt hold it against you.  Based on your responses, I am guessing you have NOT heard about the instances of big tech censoring select individuals/entities, under their banner of ‚Äúpolicy violations,‚Äù while allowing others to post similar, but different substantively, information.  Again, some of this I understand, because of your age and lack of exposure.  If you think censoring (suppressing) information (speech) you don‚Äôt agree with, just because it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative, is ok, I think you have a bright future working for one of these outfits.  If, however, you believe everyone should be given a voice, sans those who are breaking the law in doing so (I.e. engaging in criminal behavior), then we have common ground on this subject.

That's what happens when you end your first film by making your protagonist omnipotent - it's a bit difficult to come up with plausible scenarios where there's any jeopardy after you do that.

Game of Thrones was THE big thing for so long that not watching it caused you to miss out on whole spheres of social interaction with others.

I might be too late to this thread, but when I was really little (too young to remember) my dad was taking my brother and I to the mall to see Santa. However on the way, I had fallen asleep so my dad decided to turn the car around and just go home. It's a good thing he did as a plane had crashed into the mall shortly afterwards.  https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/25/us/4-killed-and-88-injured-as-plane-hits-coast-mall.html
(From an American POV)  There are none.  The left is no longer liberal, they're leftist.  The right is more liberal than the left these days but unfortunately the party "of the right" is still chock full of scumbag Republicans. It's slowly getting better but nowhere near as fast as I'd like.

Story time: I was in Hawaii when the ballistic missile warning came through on our phones a few years back. We thought we were going to die for 30 minutes. Actually, everyone thought we were going to die for 30 minutes. The bars were packed and people were really scared.   Theeeenn we got the message that it was a false alarm‚Ä¶.. calling my girlfriend of the time back‚Ä¶ was not fun
What do you mean? Like as in myself or my surroundings?
I just think that it's so sad and frustrating that society has gotten to the point where it's reasonable to default to assuming a woman is being abused. I've had to literally fight to have my husband be with me in more than one medical setting. It's exhausting when you're there because you aren't doing well, and now you have to try and convince everyone that your husband isn't an abuser! Doctors, if I'm correct, have training to identify signs of abuse. If they don't or can't, that needs more training, not banning husbands.

Dunno about others but I personally laugh at Feminism. Because all you women can really actually do is talk shit about men in a comfortable and a well protected environment.

Uncanny.  My last duty station in the service was in Florida when I decided to separate, and I decided that I really wanted to do a road trip, so I shipped everything home and planned a route to drive to California.  I went through the heartland which happened to be passing through Colorado.  I was excited about this particular movie and it came out during my trip.  I passed on it despite the extreme temptation, thinking that my mom would love to see it with me and I should hold off so we could enjoy it as a first time experience for both of us.   Doing that probably saved my life. I also ended up seeing that movie about five times in the theater between other family and friends.

Don't worry, I don't know at what point I am already, there is too much variance in my days to be able to know it, the bad thing is that those times I tried there was also this variance. You have a point there, I think and I have come to learn, that nobody really wants to die ever, it is just that we are overwhelmed by all this, to the extent that our mechanisms are flooded and they cannot take it anymore. It's true that those of us who try just want it to stop. The feeling and the time are too much to continue with. That's why I've always looked for "quiet" methods of doing it, although there really aren't any that meet the specs. I have already been and am going to therapy, although I have never felt much progress to be honest; as I mentioned, everything is a disaster with a lot of variance.

A presto electric pot. This thing is soo versatile. It can boil pasta and it can deep fry too.
I've told my son that if he wants to smoke pot, I'd prefer that he wait until he's an adult, but I won't freak out if he does. But for the love of all sanity, don't touch speed or cocaine or heroin no matter what. For us folks who have ADHD, speed and meth and any other kinds of uppers feel so amazingly good that we can end up addicted right from the word go. There are enough legal ways for us to get stimulants that the extra dangerous illegal ones are off limits.

I've had a moment like that once in my life. I got off the Autobahn to drive across rural Germany on my way home, and suddenly I just... felt like I was about to hit a deer. It was the middle of the night, so that was likely, but I'd went that way plenty of times before, there aren't even any deer crossing signs, but I was just suddenly overwhelmed with the intense sensation that I was going to hit a deer.  I drove the rest of the way home a bit below the speed limit and remained as alert as I could be. I actually braked a few times for weird reflections and shadows of lightposts. And then, shortly before my home, a truly massive rabbit suddenly ran into the road and hopped along the road in front of my car. I braked in time, which I probably wouldn't have been able to if I had gone the speed limit at my regular alert level, because there was just no way I could have seen it coming. Not exactly deer amounts of damage, but definitely a lot of unsightly things inside a broken radiator if I'd hit that thing going the allowed 100 km/h. Even with the 60 I was going, it was damn close.  Never had such a feeling again... if I ever do, I'm definitely listening.

Trader Joe's had these amazing [Mango flavored tortilla chips](https://chipreview.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/chip-rating-381/amp/) about a 15 years ago, which I've never been able to find anything like again.

In a misguided attempt at Nanny-Stating guns, California does not allow the sale of guns without magazine disconnects for this reason. The problem of course is that the majority of guns do NOT have magazine disconnects. So, what happens when Billy, who fully expects that all guns do not fire without a magazine gets his hands on a NORMAL gun without a magazine disconnect? He shoots himself because California conditioned him to rely on a safety that only exists in SOME guns, instead of relying on his brains and the basic gun safety rules.

Al Franken
He had literally dropped one the dopest albums I have ever heard and he lived only a few hours from me.  It took a friend who visited Australia and heard this new musician all over the radio to que me into him.  My friend made me a mixtape (this was that era) with three songs from the album. As soon as I heard it I immediately went and picked it up. Pretty much listed to that album everyday for 4 years straight. To this day if he puts anything out (and he does regularly) I pick it up and I haven't been disappointed yet. To this day 25 years later, he is still my favorite musician but he's still relatively unknown since it isn't radio music.     Musician: DJ Shadow

There is absolutely no reason to eat a meal on a domestic flight filled with people. 2, 3, 4 hour flights are for snacks only. Candy, pretzels, etc. If you get on a flight from Dallas to Phoenix and bring your nasty ass nachos with you, you should be removed from the flight. I don't want to smell your food and listen to you chew wjth your mouth open like an animal while you're sitting 6 inches from me.  The only acceptable time to eat a full meal next to someone on a flight is an international flight where food is being served.

I kinda panicked but then said "do you really want to kill an officer of the court?" I'm not a lawyer but he didn't know that lol.  Anyway he hit me on the back of the head really hard and I fell but I didn't pass out and he ran away. I just got some bruises and my head bled a bit.

Banging girls on sprinbreak in Cancun raw dog
Last year my dad started dating a woman I did not like or trust from the moment I met her. Single mother (which is fine but her kids are quite young and annoying), bipolar (at the time not on meds), horrible with money, who drinks and takes drugs. Quite the catch. After like 3 months of dating she moved in with her. I hated her guts so I spent all my time at my fathers place alone. My home life at my moms place was the usual horrible. Nothing new there but still shit. Then covid hit. I'm very extroverted so being alone all the time wasn't what I needed especially being at home. I couldn't go to school to escape my problems. I was going crazy. By the end I was almost all the time angry or frustrated with something and started to become unstable.   Then school started again and got heartbroken. On top of that one of the adults was really messing up bad. She knew where it hurt and made sure it did. I was depressed and became quite unstable for a while. Combine all that with all the unhealed trauma from high school and my home life and the already low self esteem. Yeah... 0/10 would not go through that again. Now that school is over for me I'm getting better. So there's a happy ending I guess.

Absolute bullocks,  I‚Äôve been hearing this for my entire career. (20+ years) The truth is that most corporations would happily switch to India if the quality of the product they are creating remained consistent but every single product I‚Äôve seen has suffered as a result of involving overseas devs. That‚Äôs not to say overseas devs are incompetent but they lack life experience from the country that is outsourcing to them. It makes business owners reluctant to involve them due to the difficulty in communication.     Hope that helps :)

Marry an old woman (74) and be her love of her life, then wait for her to have a stroke then put her into a trash bag. Drive into the middle of the United States Dessert, dig a 6ft hole and put her in there. Then go to your local police station and say your wife has gone missing while you were on a business trip, then book a ticket to a tropical island, pull our your 9mm pistol and shoot yourself in the head. Go to the depths of hell and live the rest of your life there knowing your the devil himself üòÅ
We‚Äôve had 90% tax rates on upper incomes essentially doing this.  It works fine. Obviously theres lots of money to be made to convince people its a terrible idea so no way it happens again.
Estate tax is morally wrong. You work, you pay taxes, you save, you invest, you pay capital gains taxes.By the time you are dead you have already paid taxes on the income you managed to save. Taxing it again is double taxation.

Personally, I found it to be an unnecessary amount of control over my life that I was giving away for the illusion of acceptance.  However others' experience may vary.  If it it truly brings you peace, joy and comfort, I say go for it.  If not, I'd question why I'm there.

>But the number of friends I have who were downright insulted if you weren't completely in her corner, she's the greatest thing since sliced bread, etc, was baffling.   The middle has been trying to tell the left for *years* that you can't spend 8 years (the Obama years) calling everyone who disagreed with your Guy in the White House a racist and then expect them to side with you when the next candidate comes along.  And they played the same card with Hillary.  "There's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women."  Funny, don't remember them have that same attitude when Sarah Palin was on a ticket somewhere. . .
I don't know what school you attended, but in my classes, you had to attend to pass. If you didn't rent the text or do the homework, tough. I allowed four excused absences per semester. Sleep in class? Are you KIDDING me? (Well, I had one student who nodded off in class, but she was a heroin addict.) ALL students have attendance tracked because if a college is taking federal money it has to track attendance BY LAW. (That student tuition you so proudly paid barely covered 20 percent of the actual cost to present that class.) And as an instructor, I had to teach the full hours required for each class each semester. If students didn't meet academic standards for two semesters in a row (dropped classes, failing grades) they were not allowed to register again. They were forced to take a year's hiatus.  It isn't racist or shitty--a college has a finite amount of money to spend, so why should it be wasted on someone who doesn't take his/her education seriously? This isn't high school 2.0. You don't get to goof off all semester and then complete "extra credit" to pull off a passing grade. Unlike high school teachers, I'm not a babysitter. And no one is going to pressure me to pass a student. No, everyone isn't 18. I had students from thirteen-year-olds to 83-year-olds in my classes, and some of them left the 18-year-olds in the dust. I had one student who was receiving kidney dialysis, but missed only one class.  I earned my graduate degree while I was active duty military, working a full duty day and then attending college at night and every weekend--for two years. GI bill as it exists today didn't exist post-Vietnam. Because I was active duty, the government covered 75 percent and I covered 25 percent. I received no GI bill whatsoever.
I‚Äôm pro choice, I‚Äôm even religious. I do come at it from that angle too. God tells us not to abort children but has always given us free agency whether we want to follow him or not.

No problem, I'm sure there are more. It's absolutely crazy that you can be fired for your political beliefs in the US.  In Canada, political expression is protected and your employer can't discriminate against you for supporting a political party or candidate. The protections increase for federally regulated and unionized workers. In my (unionized) position, even if I was a Hells Angels gang member, with a known drug addiction, that openly supported an extremist political party - I couldn't be fired as long as my job performance is good and my behavior while at work didn't break any company policies or safety rules (i.e. showing up to work intoxicated).

Life plays a cruel joke on me, only ever causing me to cross paths with someone I end up feeling passionately for but could never be with for one reason or another. Rinse and repeat.
In the US, once a requirement is put in place it can be modified at the whim of the ruling party. (See recent voting changes in red states)  The agency requiring ID can also restrict access to IDs.  Also, each level of government can mandate a specific type of ID for an election, thus requiring separate forms of ID to vote in an election baring federal, state and municipal matters on a single ballot.
same as twitter id say. it‚Äôs rarely going to just randomly pop up, you have to go out of your way to find it so it‚Äôs not bad tbh
Shoelaces
Same. And honestly they were way too easy to get! Mine were gifted to me by someone who had already done the background checks and had a license to carry so he walked in and out the same say. Since he‚Äôs my dad and I wasn‚Äôt paying him anything for them he could give them to me no problem. Like the most difficult time we had was when he shipped some to us. My brother had to do a class or something to be able to pick them up because we were in California which is a lot stricter.   Idk I love going to the range (I miss owning property or being somewhere with free ranges so dang much, because it gets expensive). We need stricter laws though and honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to mental health checks of some sort but I have no idea what that would look like.
I love a good apron, and they seem extremely underrated to me.
Well that was rude.

Not working hard enough.
So? The point is for enough people to have faith in the system. If you just assume that people won't have faith in it, disregard their concerns, and don't try to improve the system, things will only get worse.  You can increase the confidence of many people by implementing rather simple things (like paper ballots, random audits, voter ID). Instead, you'd rather not because a small percent of the population will always distrust the system? That's when you begin losing more moderates.   If people don't think the government is legitimate, then you have a crisis.

That the government in my country (Germany) is right to demand covid vaccine passports on entry to bars, restaurants and other places people like to go to. It's considered quite authoritarian and right wing here, but I don't see it as "the government controlling us". I see it as a necessary part of getting over the covid pandemic. People who aren't willing to do their bit for society should be banned from doing the things they enjoy.  I don't know if that's really a right wing view tbh, but I've had many discussions with friends about it and people are 50/50 on it.

Regrets, being dead is ez the only thing i fear is the last seconds/minutes where you know you will die.
I was at a summer barbecue with my parents at their friends place, probably 10 years old. There was this woman who owned a muscle car, she was heavily intoxicated and decided to get into the car to show it off to the guys, revving it up. She started it up, somehow it got put into gear.. throwing the car forward down a hill with lots of trees... her left leg was hanging out of the car and got heavily crushed by the door and trees pushing the car door closed. I'll never forget the sound of her screaming and her hot pink flip flops.
I get into awful car crashes (parents arguing leads to them driving off a bridge into a lake, spinning out of control on the road and crashing into a brick wall, car flipping 4 times). All thse dreams seem so realistic that I wake up with actual anxiety. I just got my beginners license and I've had these nightmares before although I was never really scared of driving (this theme just kept popping up every time I slept) but now I feel uncomfortable behind the wheel.   I have a huge fear of a death and I guess car accidents happen so quick and it's hard to react in the few seconds you have so it's frightens me the most (especially when it's in my hands as I'm the one driving)
He really wants to be a James Bond villain huh

Lmao good point
Really? That makes it harder for me.     I feel like pronouns would be easier to remember unless you're somehow surrounded by people constantly changing their pronouns or something similar. Most trans people obviously are trying to present their gender. No  And maybe I can only say this because I don't know many NB people, so it's still kinda unique to me, but I've never forgotten their pronouns. I might slip up in a sentence because Im not used to it, but If I recognized them I'd know their pronouns even if I didn't know their names.    My biggest concern is that I'd do the whole "oh yeah I *totally* remember you, with absolutely no memory of them whatsoever. Then I'd look like I was purposefully misgendering them when really I just have the memory of a goldfish
depends on age. teenager- $50.  20s/30s- $100. unless it's close family friend and maybe you pitch in to parents' gift, then $200-$300 for weddings/babies. but i agree with others here; it should be what you can afford. and frankly, if it's a destination wedding requiring a hotel and either flight or 3+ hr drive, i would feel comfortable giving A LOT LESS because i'm already spending significant money (many hundreds) just to be there.   you might also consider reaching out to someone in the bridal party (groomsmen/bride's maids) if they have any insight on what the occasion will be like. for example, if the attendee gift is worth more than yours, that would be baaaad.   also, for weddings, remember that you have up to 6 months to send a gift. so you can totally go to the wedding, then give accordingly.

This is not entirely true, at least in the dominant way of thinking about international relations in the US.  The US aids poorer countries often to be able to have more control over a given region, instead of another powerful nation with opposing interests, like China.

Absolutely fuckin not. If I had my druthers, Zuck would face a firing squad.  Curiously, I read that study put out by the Brits--all 77 pages of it. My coworker, who's an antivaxxer, pulled out a chart out of that paper showing that most of the patients who died had been vaccinated.  Like all antivaxxers, he cherry picked the hell out of that study. When I pointed out that that same study showed the Pfizer vaccine was 80% effective against the Delta variant, he suddenly didn't want to talk about it anymore.  His own data was cherrypicked. The vaccinated total included people who'd only had one jab.  Back to the topic. If John Doe was fully vaccinated, and gave his granny Covid, he knows that he did everything right, everything he possibly could have done.  By contrast, Fat Karen, who refuses to get vaccinated and won't wear a mask, has done nothing she could have done. The way I see it, she has committed involuntary manslaughter.   On a semi related note, a recent study showed that the antivaxxers showed the common trait of having a marked lack of empathy. I have no trouble believing this at all.

How about the following: You get issued a firearms card when you turn 18, free of charge. It's tied to the ID number on your driver's license to make it non-transferable. Every citizen gets mailed this card, whether they like it or not.  If you want to use the card, the gun shop person types all but the last 2 digits into their POS terminal, and the terminal queries the FBI database for the 100 possible returns. The clerk then manuly looks through the neatly ordered results for "your" number, and gives you the gun if it comes up clean. Otherwise (or if you don't present your card), no sale.   What this does is make it impossible for the government to know who's buying what or who even uses their card, while on the other hand getting rid of waiting periods and still keeping a background check system in place.

I'm left of centre on most things, but my most anti-left opinion is on immigration. Coming from a country which has faced mass immigration, which the government did nothing to prepare for, I have seen the detrimental impact on all aspects of society. From public services, public debate, the local population and the immigrant population. It got to the point where the politicians that allowed mass immigration began blaming immigrants for their mistakes. Basically everyone suffered to some degree.    I don't have anything against immigrants themselves. If you go back not all that many generations in my country we are ALL immigrants to some degree.    But I do have a problem with my fellow lefties who are not willing to acknowledge that immigration does have negative as well as positive impacts on the host society.    I believe it's actually a massive mistake on the part of the left and opens the door to the far right. If the left could have a open and honest discussion on this I believe we would see a reduction in far right activity and radicalism.

To me, there is a difference between religion and faith. Believing that there is a supernatural being who created all this, who loves us, who has a plan with all of this, that's faith. It helps cope with life for many billions of people. It's believing in a story to give life more meaning than it just being a random and pointless DNA race that spans out over billions of years, and of which you are personaly insignificant in the grand scheme of things. It is comforting to believe that someone out there always is looking out for you, and that he has a purpose for you.   Religion on the other hand, is the criminal organisation that abuses this faith for money and power. While relegion might unite people if they have faith in the exact same story, it will divide all of those who believe in a (slightly) different story. Religion has the unique opportunity to take your faith, bend it with fear, and control your life because it supposedly affects what will happen to you in death. People are more than eager to die for religion, and as a result suicide bombings, holy wars, and countless crimes against humanity have occurred in the history of mankind. If you think social media is bad for dividing people to make a profit, you should thank religion for inventing the whole divide and conquer strategy thousands of years ago.   Faith has a place on this earth, we could do without religion though.

I'd prefer for people to have the best chance for long-term survival, rather than to be educated and logical. Religion creates unresolvable long-term conflict, which creates competition. Competition drives technological innovation, and faster innovation means it's more likely we'll be in time developing ways to save humankind from species-killer threats like climate change, major asteroid, etc.
I grew up catholic and it was nice for me. I was scared of my family members telling me what was a sin. But it gave me a better idea of how to treat people properly. I‚Äôve been abused mentally and physically before, but it was never in the church. It was actually a place where I felt like there was someone that wouldn‚Äôt care when I messed up, as long as I knew in myself that I felt what I did was wrong. I‚Äôm agnostic now, but that feeling of knowing that even if you mess up there‚Äôs still something that will love you for you was something I needed as a child.

thanks.  im 31 years old and alcohol has almost killed me, i dont know  5000, 10,000, 50,000 times by now?  this is just my experience, but yes its extremely difficult to actually stop, if your an alcoholic, which i am
I agree but to be fair i think OP meant what excuses have people used to indirectly put someone down, I know I used some dumb excuses in an attempy to not be rude lmao it usually backfires
Not sure how to help you there

This is a garbage take. "Toughen up" doesn't get you anywhere if you don't have the skills and tools to do so in a healthy way. "Toughen up" is what we did for centuries, and it resulted in the mental health crisis we have today. Mentally ill parents raise mentally ill children. It's just that this generation of mentally ill children is more aware, which actually gives them a chance to heal in the long run.   Of course not everyone who self-diagnoses with ADHD, OCD, or whatever else is actually majorly mentally ill or neurodiverse, but hell - dismissing a bunch of them as "wimpy ass people" is what got us into this mess in the first place.   We're gaining more awareness about mental illness as a society, and the surrounding stigma is getting less pronounced. More people are getting into therapy, which gives them the tools to improve their mental health. However, it does have the side effect that some people kind of over-identify with some symptoms and falsely self-diagnose themselves. I say let's be patient and tolerant with these people because overall, this is helping acceptance in society, which can only be a good thing.

Lol that's absurd. So I'm the most stereotypical like tiny hyper sensitive blonde bitch, I'm 5'3 and I love pumpkin spice lattes etc. But oh boy is "white girl wasted" a thing. Man I can drink A LOT. like I mean in college I got in the habit of drinking the equivalent of a 12 pack nightly.   Then I got in legal trouble and it was revealed to me that my Swedish grandparents were alcoholics.   Anyway, being able to drink a lot isn't a flex.

If he did, he would hate them because of their sins, and if that were the case, he‚Äôd hate ‚Äúyou‚Äù too.

You really have to act a certain way around people to be a part of society. People will reject others' for their antisocial behaviors. This is a fact. They become an outcast or a "weirdo", so it's really important to learn how to be sociable. It's important in forming business relationships as well as other relationships.

It wasn't really coined is my point. It was in use by the LGBTQ+ community for years before every being picked up by academia, which was just describing how it was being used by the LGBTQ+ community.  Honestly, whether Latinx is good or useful or popular is not up to me- as I am not a Latin American. It seems like a nice third term to encompass those who identify as neither male nor female, but I doubt it will ever replace the terms Latino and Latina entirely.

> Are you literally comparing cops to rapists and murderers?  Wow, your powers of logic are astounding.  You claimed "most cops are good people" and then your justfification for that was the nonsensical reason that "most humans are good people" (and since cops are humans, you think that implies that therefore most cops must be good people). I pointed out the enormous flaw in this logic by giving extreme examples like murderers.  Jeeezus christ...
I lean to the left but there are definitely ideas or values from the right that I agree with. I think a lot of Americans on the left and right will find lots of common ground even there are things we disagree with.   I think a lot of political nuance is lost in the world of 24/7 news, sensational headlines designed for outrage and so on. Our two party system also encourages hyper partisanship with no compromises.    The only people who seem to be thriving from the current state of politics, regardless of who is in charge, are lobbyists, corporations and billionaires.

space is infinite but it is contained in a finite space.  basic shape of the universe is spherical. gravity causes planets and objects to pull on each other and naturally shapes spheres.   Space is curved/bent, so as a person in the space, it would appear that you are traveling in a straight line but you're actually curving when viewed from outside of space.  there's a limit to how fast you can travel, before you become pure energy from an observer in space.  so, to exit our existance, you must travel in a truly straight line. To accomplish this, you must travel fast enough that all laws of existence stops affecting you and you must maintain your physical state. Once laws of existance, like gravity, stops affecting you, you will be able to travel in a straight line and you will be able to travel to the edge of existance and then exit.  this will possibly result in several possibilities?  traveling in a truly straight line is actually another dimension of direction, and you just enter a higher dimension, or  the speed you travel at will create a reality/existance sonic boom. a reality boom. Where all of reality and existance can't fill in the space behind you fast enough. That will either create a hole in existance that will either spread out uncontrollably or reality will rush in creating a 'boom' of such magnitude that all of reality will continue to rush in; resulting in the collapse/disintegration of all existence and reality
As a close to center conservative I like this idea. It gives everyone an equal but optional opportunity, and those who use it cannot be accused of sucking from the system without returning anything because they actually did something (though, the amount of years required might have to be different for a different difficulty job). Those who don't need the UBI or those who have no motivation to improve their lives won't want to work for the UBI, and less money will be wasted.
The Liberals are not right of center, especially not when compared to what they used to be. They are center at best, but due to their need to form a coalition with the NDP (And because Trudeau wants to come off a super progressive), they've pushed far more left of center than they ever have in the past. Even Wikipedia lists them as centre-left if you don't agree with me.  If you compare the stated policy decisions from during the election, there was almost nothing that the NDP and the Liberals disagreed on. Many of the policy decisions that the NDP push for wouldn't be widely accepted by the average Canadian when push comes to shove, but the Liberals basically implement all of their policies, toned down to a level of reasonability that can actually be achieved within the government.  If you honestly think the Liberals are right of centre, what exactly do you think are their right-ish policy decisions? And cronyism or authoritarianism isn't right-wing, if you're going to go there.

For traditional left and right where I grew up (UK), I emphasise caution in glamourising sex work. The partakers are more likely to be (kids included) from lower income backgrounds, and the mental harm it can do is well documented. It‚Äôs important to avoid belittling, infantilising or demonising current and former sex workers. It‚Äôs equally important to not paint a false picture of ‚Äúsex positivity‚Äù. There is a very heavy association with violence and coercion, human disregard, lookism including discriminatory practices and objectification, lack of opportunity, and moralising on both sides of the debate (debasement and virginal).  An informed opinion: these markets of work defined by income brackets are likely to trap a lot more people then they are likely to create lasting benefits (including assisting alleviating poverty).

That's a gross oversimplification. You can have an opinion/stance on any issue and they won't always all align completely the same way because problems don't have simple solutions. That's what I gather this thread is meant to be about. If most of your views are centrist it's fair to identify as such, but that doesn't mean you can't have more extreme views on soem subjects.

What helped me deal with these "emergency nightmares" is treating the dream as a kind of practice simulation my brain runs to check if I know what to do in a real life emergency. So, after I wake up, I analyze dream-me's actions and tell myself that yep, I did a good job, so no worries, or that next time, I should improve on X and I'll be fine. It helps to curb the anxiety that (I believe) leads to these nightmares in the first place.
I can't believe you got downvoted. I agree to an extent. I wish our govt had the ability to issue and enforce mandates related to covid, but *only* because individuals won't do the right thing on their own. And neither will corporations. We have lost respect for other people in this country. That "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" mentality has become warped into "look out for #1 and screw everyone else." The irony is that the same people who rail against "big government" are often dependent on government aid (or live where it's common). And anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers will refuse to comply but run to the ER as soon as they get sick. Covidiots, as they say.

And as horrible as it is, putting it into perspective you have about the same odds of dying in a mass shooting as you do being stuck by lighting.  If we were truly trying to maximize the lives we could save, we would be increasing vehicle safety standards since your chances of dying in a car accident are about 400x higher.

Religion isn‚Äôt bad. They give followers strict moral guidelines that typically fall into what is called ‚Äúbeing a decent human being.‚Äù For instance, the Ten Commandments of Christianity. (Thou shalt not kill, cheat, lie, etc). Generally speaking, everyone religious or not should follow those. It just so happens that religious people are better at following those rules for fear of being sent to hell. Churches on the other hand can go die. Having religious figures like popes and bishops is a bad idea. It seems like they go corrupt faster than the US government.

High Intelligence comes in many forms. I'm not intelligent myself and I don't really know anyone that I would consider intelligent but my best guess would be:  They are socially awkward since most of them struggle with forming good relationships with others.   They also lack common sense. Not in a sense that they are dumb but they just have different mindsets compared to others so they struggle to comprehend what is normal or what is the difference.  They also don't want to stand out since they rather focus on what is important than indulging in their own fame. (But of course, some of them get drunk on fame that they lose the sight of the bigger picture)  They are prone to addiction (This doesn't only refer to drugs or that, this could also include sports or games) since its way for them to relax and calm their minds because most of them are always mentally tired.  Thats my best guess. I'm just a random redditor so my opinions mean shit anyway so take it as you will.

Just a heads-up, medical providers are not legally able to require your SSN. Most ask for it because it's a guaranteed unique number to identify you with, but you can refuse and they can't refuse service because of that.   Some (most?) will also use it to make it easier to report to the credit bureaus if they send your account to collections. They can still do it without the SSN, but it's slightly more difficult.

Obviously if your visa is over, it's not even possible.  If you want a legal job, not some cash-only-agricultural-almost-slavery, the same applies. You have to be registered to various social security, healthcare etc. systems.  It's actually quite a hassle to do it as a legal immigrant, I had a colleague from India, we often had to accompany her to offices to translate & enforce.  It's really hard to imagine how this happens in the US. An indentured sharecropper without any US papers strolls into a school and says that "Hi, this is my children, please edudate him/her?"

Done by design.  And each President is more extreme than the last.  We go right with Bush.  He sucks.  Go left with Obama.  He sucks.  Go extreme right with Trump.  Then go extreme left with Biden.  Which widens the imaginary gap between parties.  And now, people choose sides.  Just before a boiling point.  These political lines could well become physical battle lines.
He moved away and we grew apart, plus I also realised that they only ever replied rather than having an actual conversation.

Religion is the cause of chaos, people fight defending there own, not knowing all religions are defective. Or knowing it and ignoring it..  Remember guys, you are given a religion by your parents. You don't decide your religion, your parents do and sane for their parents.  Make doing selfless deeds your religion, that's the best way to help each other.

You realize a stare can‚Äôt tell you someone‚Äôs a sociopath..even extremely good therapists could take years to find out or never know that a client is a sociopath/psychopath because they fake outward behavior typically even better than your average person. Their behavior would have to be observed overtime or have a known history that‚Äôs enough to say somethings up, and even then they hide bad behaviors pretty well too usually. A psychopath will likely present as very relatable, trust worthy and likeable to gain trust and get what they want. Zuck isn‚Äôt any of those things I just said

I do want it to die out.   I understand that people should be left to their own beliefs. However, as long as people believe in the prospect of an afterlife & the existence of a divine guardian, they would be less motivated to deal with the problems that are very real, current and most likely to destroy our current lives.

A bit of context:  Of course, they would hide the true amount they have and transfer it overseas and stuff like that.  Other than that do you think a law of this kind would be fair? After an individual reached, for example, 100~500 million dollars worth of net worth, everything else they gained would either go to their employees in the form of salary raises or would just go straight to the government who could use it to build schools, houses for the homeless, food for the poor, better infrastructures etc.  I know it's a dumb question and that it will never happen, I just would like to know what other people's opinion is.

We have a load of crows where I live, they like throwing acorns at people near the bike racks. It‚Äôs hilarious, because the young crows do it the most. When they have chicks the following years they show their kids how to do it. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre teaching their kids the age old tradition of trolling the humans. They sit high up in the trees and aim from there. I like watching them do it to other people.

You can orgasm without release. Your body will pump still, and you'll orgasm, but you can stop from shooting; this is the most difficult version, and for me personally, only happens during long sessions with lots of swapping and edging.  The main use is to immediately bring yourself back several paces from the edge, and it gives you mental security, knowing you can enjoy sensations more deeply without things coming to an end too soon. Just that lack of mental doubt can actually make you last longer without even having to use the technique. Just being able to do it at home by yourself can be enough.  I highly recommend masturbation without completion if you want to last longer physically, but more often than not, it's mental triggers that makes people finish regardless of the gender.
If you could pay for a car in cash, it would absolutely be easier to buy a car. Your premise that to keep criminals and evil people from buying guns is to require them all to go through FFLs is ignoring the fact that most violent felons get their guns from either "black market" sales or just having an acquaintance go to a gun shop and do the background check in their place, i.e. straw purchase, which is already illegal.      https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf

An "ideal" criminal justice system would have fewer issues making death penalty problematic in the first place.  And again, death penalty has extra scrutiny. So eliminating death penalty would leave extreme sentences with less scrutiny. So on its own it's not a fully positive step.

...yes? Absolutely. The U.S. civilian populace is the most heavily armed and well equipped force of light infantry irregulars on the fucking planet. We have more small arms than most militaries on the planet put together. And an ammo budget that would make most of them drool with envy. Realistically, we would send most regular armies packing with their tail between their legs. It's been demonstrated repeatedly over the last century that strong native insurgencies are fairly unmanageable by foreign invaders.
Nah, for my country I think we have enough housing options for the homeless. Plus I don't think churches would have the best 'infrastructure' (probably a better word for it which I don't know) for housing people.

But I have a high willingness to use it as a last resort :D  Kidding, but at that points it's just semantics.  Is someone killing someone as a last resort willing to use violence? Definitly, even if they'd rather not.   Is killing the dictator of a violent regime a last resort, even if he's not threatening you directly in this moment?  You could make that argument.

Food Stamps need a major overhaul and there should be a stringent list on what you can buy with them.   Notably no high fructose corn syrup, sugar drinks/snacks high in sodium, or TV dinners.  Essentially limit to a strict regimen of fruits, veggies, protein, and starch.   Will this make people healthier? Probably not right away, but it will take away subsidies for unhealthy foods and force saturated fats to take a hike.

I would imagine there would be a lot more marriages lasting only 5 years. And probably a lot more lasting to the 10 year mark then being done.  I find this concept interesting though... would it be handled like a regular divorce then if they didn't renew? It would almost have to be... but maybe switching to a system like this could allow the country to change things up to a more fair and balanced system rather than the mockery of equality we have in the divorce courts now.  Would they still have alimony if done at the 5, 10, 15 year mark? Would the courts still give the wife the home almost every time (which the guy still inevitably winds up having to pay for since his name is still on the mortgage and she can't quality for a refinance on the home by herself like my friend wound up having done to him.) Would assets still be split based on courts rulings, or would there be a more indivualized system where people's 401k isn't on the line?  Im assuming child support would still wind up being the same if they had children though... which unfortunately family court will probably never be a fair system.

ok so let‚Äôs break this down. you said i don‚Äôt understand acne right? so i said what caused it. you said washing your face won‚Äôt prevent it. so should we just let it sit there?? i wasn‚Äôt sure so i asked what you thought we should do instead. washing your face is a preventative. obviously some acne is just going to happen. but somehow all of this equals me cracking the code that dermatologist can‚Äôt??

they also typically defund/reduce hours/reduce services of institutions meant to issue them.  or selectively pick only a few places where it can be done (none of which are easily accessible to those with limited means)  or restrict hours as to when they can be acquired.  or make the actual process of getting a free ID as complicated as possible.  or make the 'free ID' require things that cost money to track down or acquire (a certified birth certificate copy, stuff like that)  Dems main argument against them is that it is tantamount to a poll tax, and in every implementation that we've seen at a state level, it seems like a pretty good argument.

They tend towards acceptance of leftists because the motive and intent is better than the awareness of the motive and intent of the right.

Val Kilmer.. I could imagine him having violent outbursts toward anyone who criticises him, even implicitly, in any conceivable way when he‚Äôs alone with them.  Tom Cruise. Scientology is a lot of facade. A lot of pretence. Very performative. I feel like anyone who presents their entire persona in such an excessively obnoxiously performative way like that has some dark shit they get up to in secret. Maybe he just likes to dress girls up like gimps and do all that weird BDSM bondage shit.. maybe he secretly likes to dress up like a six year old girl.. maybe something more sinister‚Ä¶  A side note‚Ä¶ people often say a trucker is a well suited job for a serial killer, as they are always travelling the nation‚Äôs highways always on the move. I think the same for people in pro wrestling, especially old school so up to the ‚Äò80s  before the WWF revolution. Same principle they‚Äôre always on the road all over the country, going to some proper dives, having loads of groupies and shit, getting upto all sorts of crazy shit, and a lot of people in pro wrestling, especially back then, tend to be eccentric proper nutcase characters. It‚Äôs kind of a modern day freak show. Heck there are still Indy promotions touring around the country with a comparatively low profile compared to WWE and the other major promotions. I kinda‚Äô find it hard to believe that there hasn‚Äôt been someone involved in pro wrestling doing such nefarious things while on the road.  Marty Jannetty comes to mind.

I used to commute from eastern Long Island to Manhattan (NYC) everyday. If everything went smoothly (and that was rare) it was about a 5 1/2 round trip. Throw in a nine hour work day (minimum) and it made for an exhausting existence. As such, I slept a lot on the trains back and forth.  While sleeping on the train, I had a recurring dream. I'd be asleep on the train, dreaming that I was asleep on the train going home. In reality I was on the train going into the city, but when we got to Penn Station I'd wake up believing that my day was over, when in reality it was just beginning.  I don't know of this qualifies as a nightmare, but it was a genuinely soul crushing experience to repeatedly wake up thinking your day was done but finding out that it was only beginning.

Yeah the more the merrier! That way we can make even more sub-par "martial arts" movies!
Well, you gave me the answer I didn't know I had formulated yet.  I'm literally stumped trying to come up with a better answer, or one I feel is better, I mean. But you could tell me Woody Allen or Michael Bay is making a Neuromancer movie and I'd, eh, weirdly excited about the first and mildly irritated that I'd have to see the second.
Wow...TIL. I've never heard anyone explain the meaning for Latinx before, and I honestly have been thinking it was just referring to multiple cultures. As in, sometimes people assume everyone from south of the US is Mexican and speaks Spanish, so I thought Latinx was just a catchall term to avoid labeling people if you weren't sure of their cultural background.

I would have said "yes, I want it to die out" when I was younger.  Now I understand that if religion were gone, people would still be the way they are. Religion is a symptom of human nature, not a cause of it.  What I would want is for the aspects of human nature that lead to religion in particular to go away: Superstitiousness, tribalism, magical thinking, conformity, worship of authority, general incuriousness, groupthink, subjugation.  Remove those things and you are left with whatever was redeemable about religion: Empathy, awe, philosophy, community, and systematized tools for managing state of mind. All of those can still exist without all the hatred and woo.

The facts that this wasn‚Äôt in the OG post is surprising.
But there is a difference between *guy who is willing to violently murder dozens of people at once* and *guy who is licensed and trained to use a weapon to defend themselves and others from people actively attempting murder*. The former is definitely morally wrong, and the latter is absolutely justified.  I mean, think of any point in history. Whenever it's come down to *one willing to use violence* and *one unwilling to use violence*, who wins? Weapons, war, defense are parts of human nature. Ever since man invented tools, man has used weapons. It's not about feelings or morals. It's anthropology. You can say violence is wrong, and you'd be pretty much right, but that's also kinda ignorant of tens of thousands of years of human history showing us that good intentions aren't always enough to save your life. Sometimes you gotta fight regardless of who started it. Sometimes the rules don't help you. People get murdered every day. It happens. It's unfair. It's violent. Police can't stop every crime before it happens. You gotta be able to help yourself. Be smart. Be trained. Be careful. Be safe.

That‚Äôs a deep sort of sorrow. I‚Äôm not going to bullshit you with all sorts of platitudes.   It‚Äôs okay to just sit with that grief a while, instead of trying to pretend that‚Äôs not there or hoping you feel different. Maybe once you accept it as being there, it won‚Äôt overwhelm you so much.   In Buddhism they call that a shenpa. It‚Äôs like that splinter under the skin digging at you. Sometimes it‚Äôs a fear. Sometimes grief. The only thing you can do is sit with your shenpa. Look at it until it no longer holds sway.  Just saying‚Ä¶I have mood swings‚Ä¶goes an awful long way into recognizing they are there and minimizing their effect.   Not having good health infiltrates every aspect of life. What do you do every day that makes you feel better? I hope you have some comforting routines.   No one wishes you didn‚Äôt have insulin. Or that it‚Äôs a waste. You can‚Äôt break your worth down into such a transactional basis.

That was misrepresented by the media. There was an across the board funding cut. They didn't close DMVs, instead they cut the budget for examiners who travel from the city to satellite locations everyday. You could still get state ID, the DMV location was still open, as they were run by the county.  So the media misrepresented this.  Also, it was the intent of legislators that administration get cut, not services. They added that into the law and that essentially reverse this.  So you're basically posting a story where nothing ever got closed down, nobody was denied service, and holding it up as proof that the system doesn't work.  The media is taking advantage of you, in order to drive traffic to their site. They know you'll eat stories like that up, and so they'll package it perfectly for you. Just think, you're posting a 6 year old article about an event the media misrepresented, because it supports your position (a position that the media would have had a strong role in you forming in the first place).

The right being against puberty blockers is to me the craziest and most asshole stance they have. They say they dont want kids to make life altering decisions, something I can generally get behind, and then turn around and say nature should be allowed to make life altering decisions.

I find it kinda backwards. Nowadays everything is about being inclusive and letting people be what they want but as soon as someone says they believe in god all hell breaks loose...  And yes, I know that there are nasty sides to religion obviously but what thing in our society doesnt have a nasty side?  And no, I am not religious myself

Reddit.  I was part of the Digg exodus(Reddit's rival) back in 2010 and thought Reddit would become something cool later on because of the AMA subreddit when celebrities and famous  people started showing up but until 2016 there was a huge changed on Reddit which pretty much ruined everything I've enjoyed about this site, random subreddits which has nothing but post from Twitter(like those something people twitter). Politics suddenly invading other subreddits that has nothing to do with politics and how every time I open reddit it would default to popular in: <my country> which is annoying because I use Reddit to see what's going on around the world. If I want to see what's going on in my country I'm just gonna browse our local sites. Reddit sucks ass now, sorry not sorry.

This is my biggest gripe about the democratic party. They stopped being the party of the working class and started being the party of the elites. Just give me someone I don't already know is a corporate elitist and ill consider not voting 3rd party again.  Like somehow I'm right wing now for saying open borders causes stagnate wages that hurt the working class when Bernie was saying the same thing in 2007. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when they keep pushing that unlimited immigration is totally fine and sustainable and definitely won't hurt people in the lower classes.

I know he's been dead for long but I wouldn't be surprised if one day, we'd find out Kurt Cobain was a serial killer. He is already sus af for threatening to kill an English journalist, and during an interview he said that he was pretty much a sociopath during high school and hated everyone. If I recall correctly, he DID mention having thoughts such as committing a school shooting back when he was a teenager. Plus, there's a lot of rumours about him and how he was nothing like the media portrayed him to be (and there's books written by people who knew him who said he was pretty much an asshole and potentially a sexual predator).

The only reason you pay so much in taxes is because of fillibusting, where senators add unrelated stuff to a bill that benefits themselves and their mates instead of just passing the bill. Republicans are notorious for that, though there are democrats who do that as well.

Throughout civilization, religion has done much more harm than good.  People have been killed over religion. Wars have been fought, folks have been tortured, imprisoned, subjugated, enslaved and silenced because of religion. Cultural traditions and norms all around the world have become extinct because of religion.  Governments have been corrupted and hurt their own people over religion. It has fractured families, led to suicides, and people still continue to do all of those things I mentioned even today because of religion.  Meanwhile, all the good that can come from it and has come from it in the past can just as easily be done without religious influence, and we should strive toward that.

My favourite thing I‚Äôve seen on the internet was a wrong number text between a doctor and some rando. The doctor thought he was texting a different doctor and described the symptoms of a girl who‚Äôd come into the ER and was asking for advice. The rando said she thought he had the wrong number, but google said he should put a stent in the left radial artery. Doctor replied later that they ended up using a stent, and it took them three hours for medical professionals to figure out what she did in three minutes.

Snowden is a traitor and should go to prison.  1st off everything he said is common knowledge. Don't believe me? Start with a book called The Puzzle Palace published in 1982. It ends where  Snowden begins. That's 40 years ago people. Every good journalist in DC knew everything he said before he said it. He was just a great story for several months.  He signed off on not revealing our nations secrets. Everyone knows we have those capabilities. We abuse in them internally (in the U.S.) far less than most people realize. His problem is he told the world. And he told the world HOW. You don't do that to your fellow Intel coworkers. It's serious business. China and Russia are no joke and he played right into their hands.  The United States Intelligence community is mostly comprised of good hard working and yes many ethical people. Many Americans on both far sides of the political spectrum have little understanding of how Intel communities work. Many high level people in the military and Intel got there because they are level headed, wise, not prone to irrational thoughts, and because they care. They have seriously been back ground checked, profiled, and trained. They daily keep some of the nutters on our side in check or better yet get them fired.   He's a self serving attention seeker claiming patriotism. He should go to prison for life.  *I am left wing to the core. However I grew up I some crazy places around the globe. Most Americans have very little clue how the world works. It's not a pretty picture at all. And believe me the U.S. has killed hundreds of thousands in Latin America and way, way more than history will ever realize in Asia post WW2.  I am ashamed, and hate this until my blood boils. But Snowden wasn't dealing with that. He was cry babying about something that has gone on since Nixon. Everyone knows we keeps tabs on Americans that are not to the establishment's liking since the Black Panthers and Civil Rights. You knew that. Telling our foreign enemies HOW we do it is not acceptable. Our problems on that level need to remain OUR problems. Russia and China don't need our help defeating us. The Republicans are already doing that for them.

What gets me is when their religion says they need to eat a certain kind of bread and the government outlaws that bread. At that point they can't do their faith thingy. If it's not too much trouble we should allow people to keep their faith. If it prevents us from stopping global warming or protecting public health though, then fuck em. If it says they don't need to pay taxes, fuck em unless we all get that benefit.

I'm with you, misinformation is a huge issue on the internet, but what can we do about it? It's on the individual to check and not blindly believe everything they see like sheep.  Just scrolling through Reddit I notice multiple times a day a posts top comment will be a link calling bullshit or correcting something. I've seen it [twice](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/qgfsvm/comment/hi62fmi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [today](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/qgl772/comment/hi731ix/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that I can remember. For the most part, that stuff always has a way of floating to the top and people who didn't deserve to be cancelled get some respect back and can continue life as normal. When saying this I'm thinking specifically of James Gunn, ProJared, and CallMeCarson.  Do you have anyone in mind personally who you think has been unfairly cancelled and stayed that way?
Covid was studied and selected from Wuhan lab specifically for its exponentially age-correlated mortality rate. It was then purposefully leaked by the Chinese government in an attempt to alter their horrible age demography which is set to be crippling across the next twenty years. A secondary goal is to sew chaos in the west, specifically the US, whose society and economy is much less capable of accepting/reacting to/controlling a pandemic than China's authoritarian state. Ironically, China's current demographic struggle is the result of their past 50 years of trying to control their headcount. They have a known history of controlling population and this is in my opinion not more or less drastic. Because the world accepts they are not transparent, we also accept we have know idea of how many people in China have died of covid. My guess? Quite a few.

I don't know.. He gradually stopped hanging out with all of his friends, including me.. He used to be very extroverted but he ended up all alone and barely speaking to anyone.   I suspected that he was going through depression or something like that so I tried reaching out to him, in person, via text and via phone calls, but he would always give me the same answer "I don't want to talk about it".  I also tried asking his other friends and close family members and they told me they did not know what was going on.   I didn't know what else to do so I gave up. This was 3 years ago. Now we still talk from time to time but calling it a friendship would be a stretch.

There are these WEIRD anti-development groups in every major city in America. What‚Äôs really strange about them is they‚Äôre all primarily Spanish speaking and 1st gen Latin American immigrants are doing a lot of the protesting.  I used to see them in DC wandering around singing songs and holding signs with anti-gentrification slogans and about protecting the original inhabitants FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY. The original residents of DC are like 85% black. But for some reason it‚Äôs immigrants protesting building apartments. And I know there are similar groups in San Fransisco, New York, and elsewhere. These groups oppose and block development projects in areas with rising rents and a lack of housing.

It wasn't coined to be popular. It was initially an academic term and when it eventually trickled into the wider vernacular, people assumed that academia is demanding that it be used by everyone--very similar to the current hysteric misconceptions about critical race theory.
Capitalism or rather free market trade is the best thing that has happened to humanity in the last couple of centuries. It has emancipated billions of people, lifted billions out of poverty and is the best system we currently have. Surely it has its flaws, they are not even trivial, but most of left economical talk is regressive as fuck and is destroying something out of pure ignorance and ideology.

Exactly.   And you have to keep in mind that the Federal government has about $300T in assets. The "debt" isn't even 10% of that.   The debt is just a way to get liquid cash flow for expenditures while retaining the economic benefit those assets produce.   And it's not like the debt is money that's just getting burnt, the debt is money that the Federal government is investing into the US economy.

What about rich countries in the Olympics that can afford all sorts of special gear to increase performance versus a poor country that is year old gear?

I'm not American, but the Language stuff is also here in Germany and can be kinda annoying.   Just a few years ago when you wanted to adress e.g. a group of teachers with the phrase "Dear teachers, ..." you'd say "Lieber Lehrerinnen und Lehrer, ..." or just the masculine "Liebe Lehrer, ..." Now the "leftists" (I use that term ver vaguely in this comment) use "Liebe Lehrer:innen, ...". That colon is supposed to be a small stop, so you'd pronunce it like the feminine version, but with a stop between "Lehrer" and "innen". It just sounds strange. What's so wrong about just using the masculine or feminine form or using both like we used to?

I've been learning Spanish and it's a term I've only seen in politics. Like, it's the x is meant as a placeholder for a and o so it's not gendered, right?  Well, and I'm not an authority on this, but the whole Spanish language would have to be rewritten to "not cause offence" because it's all gendered, no?

It's meant to totally fuck with the audience and make th m feel inferior about their lives.  All corporate media under capitalism is propaganda.  ESPECIALLY THE ENTERTAINMENT.  You're supposed to look at the people on TV and see how they do MUCH better than you do despite being complete idiots or having no skills.  It's meant to trick you into believing that everyone else is managing to do just fine financially and so if you aren't it must be a problem that's unique to you.

That's kind of the thing though. Self-described party Democrats (about 31% of voters) have a positive view of the Clintons, but that's not very many people. And it's not even 100% of them. (about 76% of Democrats) It's the same as Trump. People who like a party leader and identify with that party dramatically over-estimate their popularity with the average American. The reality is most Americans probably hate both the Clintons and Trump simultaneously.  And polarization is so stable that the same percentage of Democrats have a positive view of Trump as Republicans do Hillary. About 4%. Hillary won the popular vote purely because there are more Democrats than Republicans, as far as I can tell. Especially considering how reliable Republican voters are. Independents dislike them about evenly (about 30% approval).

Dear America,  We're not mad. We're just disappointed.  Sincerely, Britain.
The problem is voter ID laws aren't generally about voter IDs at all. Look at NC for example, they passed a "Voter ID law" that required picture ID to vote, to be provided for free if you don't have a driver's license, but the bill also eliminated things like early voting, reduced the number of polling stations, eliminated same day registration, etc. Not only did it do those things, but the people that wrote the bill researched which systems minorities used disproportionately and eliminated exactly those, as a federal judge put it "with almost surgical precision". So when people say Voter ID laws are racist or disproportionately effect minorities, THAT'S what they're talking about, the *other* things that find their way in to these bills. Just like NC legislators hiding anti abortion laws in a motorcycle helmet bill, NC Dems don't hate motorcycle helmets, they just rightfully pointed out that anti abortion legislation shouldn't be involved in a motorcycle helmet law.  Other states have done the same. Hell, Ohio makes you pay for a voter ID, which I don't know how that isn't considered a poll tax.

A quote I read somewhere:  "Democrats fall in live, Republicans fall in line"  If Dems don't love a candidate they don't go out and vote, while Republicans vote in every election no matter who or what is on the ballot (that's why R's usually do well in midterms).

I dont know the credibility of this source but I read a story of this horrific time. It was something like a pastor raped a native 12 year old girl or a minor got her pregnant and then once the baby was born they threw the child into boiler pit in the kitchen .( these actions seem something that humanity think normal from days old where something like this was a consistent occurrence but hidden to avoid scrutiny. Therefore we perceive our current time a more progressive attitude of things of this evil nature but I  truly regress this idea as personally humanity is the same during the last 2000 years and has never progressed sufficiently morally. We have just progressed further with technology.

That's just it though. Everyone wants their values applied to the rules of society. In America we value democracy. We are generally offended when someone tries to take this away from America.

There are other kinds of values, fascism, piety, profiteering, frugality, order, justice, etc. We live among people with strongly held beliefs for all of the possible value systems and some extremists who would even fight to change things.

Depends on what that particular goat was for. Some animals are really expensive if they have particularly desirable lineage and are able to reproduce well. I don't know much about goats or if that's a thing for them, but if it is, you want to keep your breeder away from ones too young for it, but they're also some of the most expensive animals. Killing it not only kills that investment but also possibly multiple generations of strong stock after.  But even if it's a working goat or a goat set for slaughter or whatever kind of goat they were raising it to be, the beasts aren't cheap. If you can avoid killing one, you try to. If it starts killing the young ones, you might have to sacrifice one so you're not losing many, but that's really an undesirable outcome.

Accusations of bigotry shouldn‚Äôt be used to bully and silence people who are minding their own business, and getting aggressive about language does more harm than good.  For example, accusations of transphobia against lesbians who won‚Äôt have sex with someone who has a penis. They have the right to refuse sex with anyone, everyone has that right. But trying to turn their queer communities against them and shame them into sex they don‚Äôt want is coercive and horrifying.  On a less serious note, if I ever get pregnant, I want to be called a ‚Äúpregnant woman,‚Äù not a ‚Äúperson with a uterus,‚Äù which I find degrading and dehumanizing. I‚Äôm happy to use whatever language people want me to use for them, but they don‚Äôt get to decide what language I use for myself. Trying to ban women from mentioning vaginas or being called women so that trans women don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù strikes me as so deranged that I can barely believe it‚Äôs happening.  To many on the left, these two opinions would brand me transphobic and a TERF. In reality, I believe trans people have every right to live their lives however they see fit, and they deserve to be safe, and treated with dignity and respect just like anyone else. But I think calling people bigots for the opinions above‚Äî which are pretty tame IMO‚Äî just alienates people who are supportive but aren‚Äôt willing to have their words and choices dictated.

Ever seen the poor guy who played Torgo in Manos - Hand of Fate? ([Scene](https://youtu.be/LneQo-4qE3I&t=35s))  Too bad he didn't have the chance to become a celibrity. He was portraying a satyr but had his leg props upside down.   The resulting pain has led him to take painkillers, that show effects on him on camera.

I though we'd all be happy if religion died out, but i see now that people will behave similarly even without religion. Look at the 'woke' crowd, "cancelling" people for stating FACTS. There are some people out there that live in delusions, and hurt others because of their own delusions, and they're not even religious. I wish we could all be happy regardless of religion or or any other made up bullshit.
This is all alleged but if you go to a lot of concerts you hear things.

Also that he is very self centered during sex and doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge that the girl is even there. But again these are all second hand stories, I can‚Äôt verify any of this.

I don't care what people personally believe,  but religion should not have influence on politics and people shouldn't get special treatment due to religious beliefs. Because who is to decide what religion is "legitimate " or not? If someone for example gets exempt from a particular task at work because of their religious beliefs,  can I then just claim to worship the giant duck in the sky and get the same exemption? Who gets to decide that I'm not serious?

Unusual indeed. When I bought my iPad for the very first time, smartphones were not this major. Well, it was but not this much. There were still plenty of people without their data minutes but with 2G, 3G only capable of call and text kind of phones.    Anyway, my payment plan got pretty much attched to the tablet and like people do wih their smartphones, I‚Äôve been upgrading my iPad with the exact same plan without buying the extra phone.

Once when I was a kid on holiday with my parents on a beach in Turkey, an adorable little puppy wandered up to me. I thought it was just the cutest thing i'd ever seen. I put my hand out to stroke his head and a man who i think was a lifeguard or something said "No". I looked at him and he shook his head with a strange expression on his face and said "Sick". It was then that the little pup started to try heave and ended up coughing out what I thought was a big rubber band. Except when I kept looking it was definitely moving on it's own and turning over.  I've never forgotton that.

We promised we would stay in touch but I broke contact when I got with my wife a year later.  I found out she was in town visiting some friends recently and really wanted to hit her up but I didn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt think it would be good for either of our relationships.

Me and my friend were at his older brothers house. His older brother new a couple of dudes who owned a weed farm/warehouse (legal in California) and got bud for super cheap and in bulk.  Both of us 15 at the time and stoned as fuck on his older brothers apartment with this "friend" we knew sitting across from us. Dude must have been 19-20 ish had a car, a job, a gf and was waiting to pickup from friends older brother. To our knowledge the guy was just a normal and chill. Me and my buddy are sitting there talking about trying to get girls our age and the guy over hears and cuts us off out of nowhere to start talking about the best way to make them like you and how to seem mature for your age and whatnot. He just keeps going on and on and referring to them as "game" and just keeps stating these weird and predatory "tips" for us to use. Turns out this grown ass dude was "dating" (grooming) not one not two BUT THREE teenage girls from like 15-17  ON THE LOW WHILE STILL HAVING A GIRLFRIEND. Dude just straight up tells us this and starts pulling up some extremely revealing ass pictures of them. We just kind of stare in shock as he just brings this shit up like an achievement like normal. And then almost as quick as he started he gets up and leaves by saying something along the lines of: "best part is, is that they are all broke as fuck and have to come to me for food" and walks off to the other room and out the door. Even in our faded states of minds it was the most fucked up shit I have heard to date. I sincerely hope those girls are doing better but damn makes my skin crawl.
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3‚Äù03‚Äô tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they‚Äôre large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more

It really depends on a lot of different factors such as where you are, how you grew up, interests, etc. Some people are into it because it was a shared interest with an older family member like many hobbies. This is normal if you think about other activities like basketball, baseball, ballet, piano, etc.  Sometimes guns can be heirlooms and passed down from one generation to the next.   I haven‚Äôt really seen what you‚Äôve described in my experience. I‚Äôve travelled all over the continental US, including the southern states. I don‚Äôt think most people carry their guns around on their person. But this would depend on the person, their job, and their state laws on open carry. Just because you go to a gun show, doesn‚Äôt mean you can open carry if your state doesn‚Äôt allow it.   I think most of the people who are getting on the news / internet for open carrying guns / rifles in public, are mainly doing it for attention or they thought it would be a good idea at the time. From the instances that I recall, it seemed more like it was a group mentality where one person thought it might be a good idea.   Hope this helps.

Hey, it's not quite as advanced as what you're describing, but [GE Aviation has tested a very basic version](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-ges-use-of-google-glass-marks-a-turning-point-for-ar/) of that.

This sort of thing is coming, but it will take time. I think the biggest issue with this trial was that interfacing with the device was hard, unless the smart tools or external gestures (smart gloves?) worked well.

Keeps you from dehydrating. When you are hydrated properly your skin can look better. Also the water in fruits and veggies counts as well. If you are thirsty drink water. There is no need to shove water into your body just to do so. A well-balanced diet and a few glasses a day is normally enough for the average person.

Surely there will be some regulation of the train line itself, such as safety precautions taken at rail crossings. Those things are done for the public good. *Similarly, any venue that creates and serves food is also going to be regulated for safety.* A bakery will likely have visits by a public health inspector, and are expected to keep their shop and their equipment up to certain safety and hygiene standards. Again, not unlike a private train line.   Just because you think something is not regulated, doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs the case. And you don‚Äôt just get to set some arbitrary standard, as to what is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù regulation for you to think it‚Äôs important to require the company to prevent discrimination.

They are EVIL. Like you I hadn't encountered them for a good part of my life, but one summer we went to spent a week at my aunt and uncles lakeside cabin. After 9 hours of driving we rock up, unpack a bit, and head to bed.  The next day all hell broke loose. Apparently that was the day all the horseflies hatched, along with all the mosquitoes. We spent as much time as possible submerged in the lake to keep them off of us but same as you, they seemed to know we'd need to breathe and wait for you. My cousin in law had brought out his horses and their necks were dumping blood from all the bites. We tried going down the road to a convenience store and ended up running flat out trying to get away from them. We ducked onto a trail in the woods that was a shortcut, only to be found by the moquitoes.  Hell of a "vacation", but at least it was memorable lol.

Sony lost a fortune putting these into play stations. Microsoft essentially see the future of video and game delivery getting online, so they threw the towel in.

Normally porn dictates the winner. This time Microsoft saw the future beyond a disc and went "meh"

I see, it is interesting,  Would you say tho, that there are things that a right? And things that are wrong? Like rape or murder is wrong?

My erection got too big for its britches and my foreskin split just below the tip. Plenty of blood. Had to get circumcised in my mid 20s including stitches.   Healing was NOT fun - woke up early each morning with the pain of stretching stitches because of the usual morning stiffness. Took me a day or two to work out that, when it woke me up, I had to read a really boring book - in my case a text book on constitutional law - which would alleviate the pressure and I could go back to sleep. A week or so later I worked out if you sleep with knees to chest you can‚Äôt get a proper boner, made things okay.   Definitely I got the op. Never had a problem since. Lady friend had the unique experience of the same boner with and without foreskin. Preferred without.

Anytime we tried to have sex again I always smelled poo. This ended our relationship.

Scat fetishism.  On some of the more peculiar nsfw sites I browse I'll find some art that first seems to jive with my tastes, but then things will take a turn as the animation, sequence, or comic, evolves into something scatologic and it quickly kills my mood. I have an odd mental aversion to filtering, so this just keeps happening every few weeks or months  Scat fetishism is certainty not extraordinary common, but it's far less niche than I expected.
i like the meta-story of the snyder cut as much as the actual movie.   dude has a well-earned reputation as a self-indulgent meathead, and then, due to historical circumstances which will never exist again, he makes the most self-indulgent, meatheaded thing he possibly can and it fucking rocks. total redemption arc.

My 21st birthday I lived at home for school full time and worked two part time jobs. My parents left to go out of state for my brother in law and nephews birthday party (which are a few days ahead of mine). I couldn‚Äôt go because I had to work so all of my family was together.   The day of my birthday I got nothing. I went to class and to both jobs and took myself out to eat after. About 1145p I got a bunch of happy birthday texts from all my family, making it clear that while they were all hanging out, someone finally realized and in their guilt all texted me at the same time.

I don't really like my parents that much (my mom is always so annoying and after I told her one of my secrets she started treating me really badly and never missed an opportunity to have a go at me or scold me) but if you really ask my relationship with my mom is infinitely better than that with my father. My father is a raving, mad, idiotic, angry, grumpy, freaking uncivilized animal that can walk on two legs and talk like a human. He thinks he's always right,  that he's always best and that no one should contradict him because they will be wrong.
Yeah, but when Dave Chappelle tells some "transphopic" jokes it's all "We want ...!" I haven't seen the whole special, but enough to know he wasn't trying to be transphobic, and I agree with him that his transperson friend would have laughed at those jokes, because she was a comedian too.

Happened to me twice now.

No one took up the mantle so I did, and really enjoyed it! Legit just asked if I could talk to her outside of class and said if she had any issues she can talk to me directly bc im more than happy to figure things out.

Be safe; Be healthy, avoid disaster!  Change A/C filters at least every 6 months. If you rent, ask your landlord about it. You'll lower your elec bill and have cleaner air.  Know where the breaker box /electrical panel is and make sure the circuits are clearly marked.   Install smoke/co2 detectors - set an appointment in your phone to check batteries every 3 months.   Have a plan to get out of the building in a fire or other emergency. Practice it. How are you getting out of the building? Where will you go? Have a "bug-out bag" near the exit. Think about what goes in the bag: spare clothes, toiletries, cash, first aid, important phone numbers, back-up ID? Multi-tool? Burner phone?(Everyone's situation is different, figure out what YOU need to get to safety so you can figure out your next move)  Make sure door and window locks are good and strong and you know who has the keys. Give a spare key to a trusted friend or neighbor put it in a clearly marked envelope with your name, phone number, emergency contacts, any special instructions and a password if you need to send someone to get the key or let into your place. Set a calendar event to ask your spare key person if they still have the envelope key and instructions. Update info as necessary.  Consider having a weapon for self-defense and learn to use it effectively. Baseball bat, hammer, knife, gun. If someone wants to break in and harm you, how are you going to stop them/stay alive long enough to call 911? Someone you know is a "gun person," find out who and have a private conversation they will be more than happy to help, I promise. This goes double for females.   Covid taught us "prepping" is not crazy, it's wise. Try to set yourself up to be comfortable (not just survive) if you had to lock the door and stay inside for 2 weeks, a month? Longer?   What if the power goes out?  Candles, power bank, spare batteries solar charger    some of this stuff can get expensive. Christmas is coming. üòâ  You're on your own now think about your personal safety and that of room-mates, pets, etc. Plan ahead to handle life surprises and you'll find that being prepared can keep emergencies from turning into crises.   A little planning can make a world of difference so be smart and be safe.

Australia, I assume?  In that context, "liberalism" is usually used to refer to classical/economic liberalism, which is usually associated in the US with libertarianism. The US connotation of "liberalism" refers to social liberalism, which emphasizes bolstering personal freedoms through economic regulation and strong legal safeguards.

When I had this realization while puking my guts up that if my wife were pregnant (we were trying to conceive around that time period) I would be in no shape to help or drive when she went into labor if I continued being such a lush.  I quit drinking that night. We only have a mixed drink at dinners on special occasions now.
My most uncomfortable thing that happened during sex was when I was with my first girlfriend and sexual partner ever. We had sex one day, of course I was raw dogging it since she was on the pill, and when I pulled out my dick was covered in blood and I freaked the fuck out. I seriously thought my dick got cut off or something - so much blood. Welp, good news it was just heavy menstrual bleeding and my dick is fine, bad news is I can't really ever have sex during a woman's period üòï

First real video game I ever played was this spaceship combat flight game I've long forgotten the name of, it was on Windows 95 and I was like 7-9 years old, and I had this ancient joystick I used with it, really wish I could remember, maybe I'll visit r/TipofMyJoystick about it sometime. But that was my first real delve into video games, then Sega Genesis came afterward and I've been obsessed with games since, like 20 years later so far

Twice in my life has lice been an issue.  Once at 14 i got it from some girl at camp. 3 treatments of torture preparing to cut off all of my hair.   The second time, my 2 yo got it from the babysitter's grandkids. I bathe my child every night and scrub her hair.  One day i noticed she had an adult louse in her hair and freaked out.  I got all the treatments, particularly  lice repelling hair spray, and prevention shampoo on top of all the killing stuff for hair and furniture.    Immediately texted the babysitter's daughter and told her to check her children for lice, since they got watched at their grandma's house with my 2yo occasionally. Her 3 kids had gotten it once already months before (yay school) and she now had a special needs baby in the home.    She knew already.  She had found the lice days before and admitted via text that she didn't think to text me when she found her toddler's hair crawling with dozens of lice( DOZENS! ). Why?  " my kids are rarely at their grandma's anymore."  GIRL!  LICE IS NOT LIKE A COLD.  BEING IN CONTACT WITH 1 PERSON WITH LICE CAN CAUSE IT TO SPREAD.  after treating my daughter's head,  mine,  and my husband's we found:  1 adult lice.  Over 30 eggs. On only the kid.  He and i didn't get it.   We sprayed the whole house. And i made damn sure i killed and removed all of those eggs.  I nit combed that poor baby multiple times a day for a week straight,  making sure i got them all. The following day after treatments i went to the babysitter's and saw her youngest grandchild in the livingroom.     I said, "oh!  Your daughter must've told you about the lice!.  Did you get treated too?"  "... WHAT LICE?! Do you mean from months ago? "  "Uh.  No.  I mean from over the weekend.  Your daughter found lice last week in the girls' hair and i found it Saturday in 2yo... she didn't tell you? "  "NO! What do i do?  no one in my house has ever had lice before?!"  My kid did not end up staying that day.   So.... yea.  Needless to say she pissed off not only me,  But her own mother by not telling anyone about the lice.  (I gave the babysitter advice on treatments and repellents. She got lucky no one in her home had any) We got rid of the lice 100% within that first treatment ( though we treated our hair religiously for a good few months with lice repelling detangling spray after that until lockdown because we stopped going to the babysitter who's immuno compromised).    The daughter on the other hand.... aparrently never figured out how to treat  correctly and didn't kill them all that time either. Middle of summer during lockdown all 3 girls had it again. So badly that the daughter gave all 3 buzz cuts.

Wherever you want to put it. Like every art form it's very subjective. The way you appreciate music is something very personal and unique.   People obsessing too much over what's deep and meaningful aren't looking for a better understanding in music. They are just looking a excuse to say my taste is better than everyone else's look how special and unique I am.   Music can be just fun, catchy and enjoyable. The preaching and the philosophical views are an extra.

From what I understand, not subsidizing many of these crops would result in either the cost of food causing significant economic hardship on almost everyone or would make the income from farming so low that nobody could afford to do it. Again, an imperfect system but many countries do the same as it's a hard problem to avoid. This is strictly speaking from my experience but having grown up in and worked in farming communities, these subsidies are used by individual farmers who couldn't afford to farm otherwise.

Being abusive for no reason, way you sort it out is tell them to fuck off.  I was friends with a guy who doesn't speak to me anymore who was with this girl who treated him like trash, an example is that he told her about a guy who bullied him really bad so in response she tracked that guy down and tried to make them friends despite the fact he didn't want that and he actually tried to end the relationship then and there (she had done things like this before she would even try it to me).  After she began forcing him into sex and then faking a pregnancy every time to try and force him to stay.  All he had to do to stop this was just not be around her aswell so yea if she keeps going against what you want then it's bad
yeah.. lots  it was whatever, it didn't really affect me  i grew up in the hood in NY, i saw a lot of dead junkys/OD.  i think the first time i saw a body was on my way home from school in 4th grade.  a guy got stabbed outside a bodega and i watched him crumple to the floor and bleed out.  i dunno, it didn't really do anything to me.  i honestly don't think it affected me at all.  shit happens, people die.

Unless the dad and uncle are both registered on whichever website, there shouldn't be an issue with accidentally revealing a family secret. Since the buddy is related to both uncle and dad, then all their relatives would show up anyway.

Yea of course!! And female, mid 20s, def had my ups and downs of nose confidence/body confidence in general. It sounds weird and I don't like the associating of changing a physical part of yourself to like a feature but I really started liking my nose when I got a pixie cut. Made me feel like it stood out less bc seeing the back of the neck gave it more space and felt a lil even? Im growing my hair out now for the first time in years so its been a bit weird but im making do
Man Big time I really was sick of the NFL Last year because of the Raiders moving to Vegas So I Became a local niner fan just because I felt jipped and they made it to the super bowl which was nice and lost and man I felt dumb The xfl came and I said alright this could be my shit I No questions about it became a die hard NY Guardians Fan‚Ä¶then covid hit man it was rough ü§£ Needless to say I‚Äôm back where I started once a raider always a raider And Vegas Doesnt Look too bad on em

What part of the post said that this person was past the barricades?  Edit: You also can‚Äôt go after people on what they potentially could have done. There are cameras everywhere, if they committed crimes they will be brought to justice. Its just not right to go after people unless you have proof of wrongdoing no matter how wrong or stupid you think they are.
Don‚Äôt consider myself a musician but one time I was messing around with my keyboard and I thought I created the next masterpiece. It sounded familiar to me. Turns out it was the intro to Jurassic Park.

There was a period where I was shoplifting, I got caught, once when i was 35, (Police involved) and second time 38, when i was home for the holidays. It was in my local shop, i tried to run but was stopped. About 10 employees surrounded me nd put me in a room, but they let me go, thank fuck, it would have  ruined the family holiday, and my family would never look at me the same again. I still wake up thinking about it at 3 in the morning, almost getting a panic attack. Havent taken a thing since then.  When ever something bd happens now, i just think, "well thats karma, you deserved it"

Mine isn't nearly as good as any of these but I was hooking up with my ex in his car and this red neck in a truck called the police on us because apparently the spot we parked in was a place people did drugs.

i actually rewatched this last month because i found it on an old hard drive. it's a solid dumb action movie which never pretends to be anything else. not really a great tentpole summer blockbuster, but it's an honest attempt at a throwaway action movie.   it takes itself the exact right amount of serious. it's not constantly winking at the audience and going "look how STUPID this premise is haha", but it also doesn't try to be "a bold statement" or "the voice of a generation". you get some spectacle for a couple hours and then it doesn't ask you to ever think about it again. i kinda respect it for that

It takes ages for coats to dry properly and we get to plan the designs together and then chatter while I paint them on. It‚Äôs always fun and silly and gentle.  That sounds really goofy when I type it out now.

he's not blaming her for it, i don't like the malice is warranted. obviously if she sounded upset when she said it the OP wouldn't be confused. it's more likely that the 'ugh' was to indicate that she moaned and then said it nonchalantly.  which is still a trauma response that happens sometimes, but if the OP isn't up to speed on that, obviously they would be confused thinking she was turned on by her trauma.

I think my Dad committed suicide. It was the day after I turned 20 I got a call on my way to a baseball game that my dad died. How he died is where the confusion if it's an accident or a suicide. In 2016 he was in for a simple surgery he flat lined after that he was in a coma for 2 weeks I wanna say. The doctor said he has a 25% chance if living and if he did he's just me a vegetable. So when he did survive and was walking it was a miracle all the doctors and experts we talked to said there's very very little hope and there he is. 1 thing was different. (This plays a huge role in this stick with me here!) The first change was he had something called and LVAD you're welcome to do your own research on it but what I was say is it's a motorized heart that's gave his a constant flow of blood he had no heart rate it was pretty cool! And he had to keep him self charged and made sure he had plenty of battery's to change out during the day. Needless to say he couldn't work and he was a very successful business man high up at Subway. He lost all that and had nothing he was living off his wife who only married him for his money and status. When he passed we went through his phone they were not together he was living back at his mom's who had sever dementia and was forgetting who he was. That night on my birthday he went out drinking and I got calls from friends who said they were out with him and he was just acting different maxing out all his cards buying everyone drinks. I wanna remind you my dad was broke. He left us nothing in his will and I don't care at all but I just wanna remind you his situation. So that night he got home and passed out in his car and didn't charge his LVAD which is his heart. I think my dad was so depressed he wanted to see me his youngest from his first wife grow to be 20, live it up like he used to for one last night and call it there. My dad was 53 when he passed away. I can't say anything about it because I just can't bring me self to speak out
The movie literally opens with 20mins of monkeys hitting sticks together, every shot is dragged out way longer than it needs to be, the film is poorly paced. People have made fan edits of the film that are 30minutes because it‚Äôs so slow

Professors, they have virtually no accountability and often they are people who have never held any type of job outside of academia, yet they have so much power over your future by giving you a grade that will follow you for the rest of your life. When I was in undergrad there was this one Biology professor at my school who was a miserable human being; mood swings, extremely political, insecure, coke head, and not very knowledgeable about Biology tbh. She failed 70% of a cell biology section (as in F), literally failed students even if they were putting the correct answers down on tests just because she was insecure. The Science department didn‚Äôt bat an eye or care until some of the students threatened to sue. She ended up getting fired mid semester a year later for pissing off the people that were covering for her in the first place.
That is exactly why history shouldn't be rewritten. We have to own our mistakes and learn from that. It's the same way a child grows up to adulthood, by doing mistakes and learning from them, because no one is perfect.

Master and Commander: Far Side of the World
Yeah the documentary was right, there is a town or city where they had a pilot program where people were encouraged to write down things about their neighbors.  But it was just a local pilot program, not a nation wide social credit system.  China is a very big country and local governments have a lot freedom to experiment with all kinds of systems and policies. Almost any thing you can think of happens somewhere in China. But at the same time, for 99.9% of the population there is no such an invasive neighbor snitching system in place.  And there are camera's equipped with facial recognition and even cameras that can identify someone by the way they walk.  In fact many of the new camera's installed by governments all over the world, come equipped with facial recognition. In all countries not just in China.   That is a worrying development and it is invasive but not just a Chinese thing.

The answer has actually changed a few times since I got vaccinated.  When it first happened, it was more about respect, easing others' concerns, and not looking like some jackass who wasn't taking the pandemic seriously, on top of the fact that it had become a habit, and the pandemic was still on, so why change now?  Like, I walk into a restaurant for lunch and the staff are all wearing masks, it feels disrespectful to not be doing them the same reasonable courtesy, you know? If I have to explain that I'm vaccinated to not be disrespectful, that says that I've already made them uncomfortable, and I would like to avoid that.  Then, as time went on, the delta variant started rising, and we started getting breakthrough cases, at which point it became pragmatic: The Vaccine improves your odds, and so does social distancing, and so does wearing a mask. All 3 together give you some really slim odds of getting a serious infection of covid.  Over the summer, my job at the time lifted our mask mandate in the office for people who are vaccinated, but I still wore mine walking to and from my car, and when I went to get lunch, just to be safe and not worry anyone else that I was gonna be an irresponsible jackoff. Near the end of the summer, my whole family got a group text from my sister (a doctor) that she was treating a breakthrough case in a vaccinated patient, and encouraging us all to go back to wearing masks more strictly, so I started wearing my mask in the office again, and when my manager politely asked (we were talking 1-on-1 about something else at the time), I mentioned why, and said I wasn't going to be hounding anybody else about it or making a big fuss, but that I personally was going to go back to wearing a mask just to be safe. Like the next *day*, company policy changed back to masks for everyone. Someone mentioned that the CDC had changed the guidelines, but I'm not convinced that I didn't very politely get the mask mandate reinstated in that office by accident.

You can feel that way, not going to try to convince you otherwise. In general sometimes I tend to think if an individual is guilty of something especially heinous they don‚Äôt deserve to go on.   But are you okay with the fact it would cost more?  And what about the people who don‚Äôt steal an entire life, but employ slaves? That are judges and send children to punishment because they get kickbacks from the establishment using them for labor?  What about executives, who arbitrarily raise the price of medication people need to survive each day just for profit, or those that work to keep low level employees from prospering?  Where is the line? Just direct physical violence? And when does it become justifiable considering the huge costs; of extra trials, and years of special imprisonment?

No job is worth sacrificing your mental health. Don‚Äôt stay because something is comfortable or seemingly stable or you‚Äôre afraid it‚Äôs worse elsewhere if you aren‚Äôt happy. Any job can drop you at any time for any reason outside your control anyways so if you aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs 100% what you want to do, try something else. you‚Äôre young and it‚Äôs way more important you have good work experiences and mentors helping you grow than staying somewhere from guilt or comfort or loyalty. You‚Äôre building the foundation of your whole career so what you accept from employers now will influence how wherever you work feels like they can treat you in the future.    Focus on companies who have a good work culture, advancement opportunities, and/or skill development (like paying for you to take courses).      Never feel guilty for needing time off or asking for it, especially for taking vacation days. Use them all even for a random long weekends if you don‚Äôt have a big trip you wanna do to give yourself a break.    Be nice to everyone at work because you never know who you‚Äôll end up working with in the future. Networking is key to make connections in your industry and can open so many opportunities to you especially in competitive environments.     If you have benefits, USE THEM to their fullest capacity. Get your eyes checked, go to the dentist, get massages, whatever you can because you never know when you might be without them again so leverage them while you have them.
We had issues with one of our neighbors over our "wild" garden islands in our yard. We plant native flowers and grasses and let them grow and bloom in those areas. We don't use "weed" killers on our dandelions or clover either. We have birds, snakes, skunks, foxes, rabbits, etc. We love the fact our yard is an animal habitat.       The neighbor claimed the native plant islands, which have their own decorative borders, were "neglected" areas and were a code violation.       The code enforcement officer came out, took a look, and said they were considered legal landscaping.       Then he investigated the property lines and fined the neighbor who called in the complaint for building his privacy fence directly on the property line. Code says you have to leave a few feet offset. Which we did when we installed our picket fence.       Our neighbor had to tear down the fence, have it resurveyed, and reinstalled. He also had to remove his shed and relocate it.       Karma's a bitch.

In a recent post that made it to the front of reddit from r/Superstonk they talked about how everyone sees what is happening but people don't see to join and jump on board with them.   I wanted to ask a few questions but didn't have the karma to post anything so ill ask here.   If I want to learn more about stocks and apps/applications for buying and trading then where should I start?  If I want to learn more about it all then want are some good resources a simpleton with a small brain like my self can go to learn?  Are their any apps or information sites I should avoid while learning or trading/buying?  Thanks from a colleague kid who wants to do better.

I‚Äôm going to admit something. This is going to sound like humble bragging, but that‚Äôs not how I intend it. I‚Äôm just saying it to prove a point.  I recently had my 40th birthday. The original plan was to send the kids to my in-law‚Äôs house for a few days, and do a little stay-cation with my wife‚Ä¶ explore the touristy parts of our own city that we never actually go to. But the quarantine cancelled all of those plans. We‚Äôd budgeted about $500 for that (mostly for restaurants and admission to places), so I decided to go on Amazon and treat myself to something from there instead.  After a combined three hours of online shopping over two days, I was only able to find a single thing I kind of wanted that was under $500: a new hoodie. It was about $40. There was literally nothing else I wanted at that price level. Well, I should say instead that everything else I wanted at that price level was closed due to the quarantine.  I briefly considered purchasing about 100 comic books from the early 1990s, to complete a few series that I began collecting back then, when I was in middle school. I had the comics in my cart and everything‚Ä¶ total price around $450. But then I thought about it some more, realized it would just end up as more crap in the basement, and thought my way out of buying them.  I‚Äôm at the point in my life now where I have pretty much everything I need, except time and experiences.  When it comes to tangible things, I‚Äôd have to have a budget of several thousand dollars before I started to find things I really wanted and didn‚Äôt already have, like a motorcycle or new MacBook Pro. Even then, though, at this point, I‚Äôd likely talk myself out of them‚Ä¶ opting instead to put that money towards something more sensible, like my IRA or paying down my mortgage.  Being mature and responsible with money kind of sucks the fun out of things sometimes.

I have plenty of stories for this  -One night my alarm went off at 5:00 AM, i wanted to sleep for like 30 minutes more so i set up an alarm for 5:30 AM. Mind you, i was awake, i grabbed my phone from the nightstand, put it on my belly so i would quickly wake up from my alarm. The alarm went off and the clock showed 4:00 AM. I was so confused that the confusion woke me up.  -This happened when i was in school, i was sitting at the back of the class and i could see the clock from my seat. I was writing something and i got bored so i looked at the clock to see if it was almost the end of our period. As i was trying to read the clock, the minute hand moved counter clockwise, it moved back 6 minutes. I was extremely weirded out and to this day i‚Äôm trying to convince myself that i was just probably tired.  -I have a habit of checking the time but i don‚Äôt know why, i just do. I was on my phone and i was watching random shit i could find on youtube. Out of habit i looked at the time and it read ‚Äò11:34 PM‚Äô. I took a mental note since i was supposed to do my homework at like 12:00 (my brain works better at night. don‚Äôt judge me). Halfway through the video i was watching, i checked the clock again but this time it read ‚Äò9:34 PM‚Äô. I sat there for a minute trying to process what just happened.   To this day i still don‚Äôt have an explanation. (sorry if there are a few incorrect grammars, english is only my second language)

I see where you are coming from but I also see real danger in this. We are quite good already at repressing negative memories, which usually has a bad effect on our mental well being. You would be tempted a lot to never face the problems you need to face to improve your live and take responsibility for yourself, your family and community. Somewhat similar to what happens in the movie "click" with Adam Sandler.  A super memory would imo be really insanely powerfull. Actually probably the most real world power of all. Just imagine being able the memorize thousands of books. You'd be absolutely unstoppable in any field.

Don't sweat the small details.  Look at the bigger picture. You got this.
End capitalism, encourage mixing of societies. Economic stress breeds resentment, and poverty-stricken communities will always look for someone to blame. Poverty is a necessary aspect of capitalism, so replacing it with an economic system wherein every person‚Äôs basic needs were met would go a long way toward reducing/ending hate-based violence. To paraphrase a line from a show, happy people don‚Äôt shoot up grocery stores/synagogues/mosques/whatever. At the same time, unfamiliarity with other cultures is the primary cause of xenophobia‚Äîhaving mixed communities that are socially and economically linked is the best way to reduce hatred overall. Kinda like how a lot of Christians are taught to hate and fear gay people but end up meeting/working with gay people in high school or college and change their minds.

Not exactly a canon story, but I read an Undertale fanfiction where Asriel Dreemyrr died at the end and it got me sobbing because the writing was s o good that the death plot was excellently written.  Another death that hit me hard was
yep that is brutal
At least she got to slap him in the face.
Hmmm... That sounds rather... Attractive. I'll take that into concideration.
Of course the south is/was racist. I am not denying any of that or the fact that they wanted to leave due to 'state rights' which actually meant state rights to enslave people.     It's just how enthused people get about how bad the confederacy was for trying to leave... when your whole country only exists because you had a civil war against Britain.     You would think there would be some pass through and some people would go "the confederacy were cunts... but we should let them leave"

I got into Final Fantasy in middle school when I was going through a lot of shit. That was really the first game/fictional story I really got into and attached to and I empathised with Zack especially because I had a whole ‚ÄúI wanna be a hero‚Äù complex       His death (the 7 compilation in general) was really designed to make you feel HARD from the fact that the game makes you keep fighting until it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs done for, to Clouds heartbreaking outcry, to seeing him essentially be guided to heaven by Angeal and telling Cloud ‚Äúif you see Aerith, say hi for me‚Äù       My dream back tattoo is angel wings, a buster sword, and ‚ÄúHey, would you say I became a hero‚Äù

It‚Äôs a stress reliever for those that are hooked, and to reduce stress probably outweighs the affects of smoking itself. The bads would be cardiovascular and respiratory health, and also all the shitty weather you have to endure.

It‚Äôs Disney‚Äôs MO. I guess you can‚Äôt have a life defining adventure unless your parents are dead. My favorite is Frozen where the parents just disappear behind a wave. They‚Äôve been able to keep parents alive by obscuring them or turning them into bears, but dealing with parents for Disney productions must be like how the rest of us deal with drawing hands: **JUST GIVE THEM STUMPS!**
Had a headache even the day after because I cried non-stop for half an hour. I had to come downstairs to eat and I couldn't say why I was crying, they would have made fun of me.

I always feel so sorry for those people. Fair enough if that energy gets you going, but the concept of labouring so hard for money in the world we live in just seems like a sad existence. Especially since they are only working so hard to claw themselves into a slightly better living standard because of wealth disparity.  No different than a closeted shut in, or a drug addict; businessmen are just upsetting to watch. Slicing years off their life to burn faster, just so they can buy a nice watch or fast car to sit in traffic with because that's what everybody says success is.  Ultimately, this concept of working hard to eventually become a millionaire is a scam. All those LinkedIn people are just faking success to make money out of our envy. It's all a big old fantasy.  I feel blessed to have had some truly truly terrible jobs, allowing me to peer behind the curtain a little. I don't want millions or hundreds of thousands, I just want enough to be comfortable. I don't see constant growth and wealth and success as important anymore... I see it as greed and a unsustainable culture.  Hopefully the next generations will realise this and work towards what truly matters.

It upsets me when people don‚Äôt see it, because as you said‚Äîfor all her flaws, JKR is a fantastic storyteller and writer.

Now this anime was pretty terrible, but I watched Charlotte in high school. The plot of the show is people are suddenly developing supernatural powers and the governments around the world are doing really inhumane things to utilize them. The main character lives with his younger sister who is an absolute idiot and really gets on the main character's nerves. She cooks horrible meals that are too sweet and refuses to back down on the subject. So the main character is pretty... Disconnected from his sister. He doesn't eat the food she makes for him and spends a lot of time around other people.  The main character is out at school one day when his sister develops the ability to spontaneously create massive earthquakes. Well this power activates when she is being bullied and she brings the entire school down on her and dies.  There is a scene where the main character is in his house with some of the last meal she cooked, which is beyond spoiled at this point. It's cold and he left it home without eating it. His sister is dead and he let one of her last acts of kindness go completely unappreciated. This shit.... *Hurt* me. I was so fucking torn up by this scene where the main character just locks himself in his room because he doesn't know how to process his grief. This man is just destroyed and it ruined me.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw dude visibly relax and sigh. I'm assuming not everyone stops. It's on a road

>amazing television series    Wellllllllll‚Ä¶. it started off amazing anyways. But try to keep it down, lest you summon the wrath of r/freefolk.
I feel the same, such a fan of the show, so thoughtfully written. Even when they took more time with the idea, like with the regulars from Mad TV (Nicole Sullivan & Mike McDonald) doing small but essential repeat cameos that came to a satisfying head.   And regarding standout guest spots? Michael J Fox, Jack from Will & Grace, Brendan Frasier, Tara Reid even played great... well past my bedtime so I won't reach further.   But big mention to their Musical episode, maybe top 3 in the competition of musical sitcom specials. I'd put Scrubs, Drew Carey Show & Buffy for my musical episode finalists.

Because its true, you might feel like an adult when you hit teen years but just a few more years and you'll realise you really weren't.

Not to be fucked around with and not canned using constructive discharges, like a bunch of petty write ups.   I'm getting ready to take the LSAT to go to law school and become a labor attorney. I'm 30, so it's been a long going dream of mine.
With Arthur while it was sad it didn't hit me quite as hard as having played the first game I knew that there won't be a magic twist to save him. In RDR1 I sat shellshocked for half an hour after the last mission.
Ned Stark in ASOIAF series. This was before the series had launched and i had not seen such a prominent character die so early in a series before in the limited amount of fiction I had read till then. It was very shocking for me and I kept hoping that he was somehow going to come back in some way. But as time went by, I had a greater appreciation for such kind of fiction where anything can be expected and no one is safe. Great mind opener.

Vote by mail. It's so easy. Get your ballot in the mail, fill it out and send it back, or drop it off at a drop box location.   The drop box I use is at a voting office, which is right next to a police department and covered by cameras. Someone would have to be a complete idiot to tamper with it, they would get caught immediately because their offices are in the same lot.  You can check online a few days later to see if your ballot was received. Took about 2-3 days last time. It beats the heck out of standing in a long line. It gives you plenty of time to vote.

Sadly I think people become more out of touch the older they get, not wiser. Same with people who become wealthy, you stay rich long enough you forget what being broke is like. I even feel the same about just becoming an adult. It angers me when adults say "what do kids have to be stressed about", then when a kid who's stuck in an abusive family says they hate their family people just dismiss it as a kid being angry at their family instead of seeing if there might actually be a good reason for it. Like if that kid grows to be 30 and still says he hates his family, it's not a rebellious teenage phase, something is wrong.

Apparently they also filmed/plotted Walt outright killing her, but decided it was too soon in the evolution of the character for that. So the death showed was actually the lesser of two evils
There is no simple answer to this question.  &#x200B;  Knowing or not knowing something is partially the responsibility of that person.  Example:  You join a cult and they convince you that anybody you murder goes straight to heaven.  So you kill your parents.  You believe you are doing good, but it was your responsibility to not let yourself get manipulated like that.   So a judge will probably find you guilty and I'd say you're quite a bad person.  &#x200B;  However in some cases, the cause for those beliefs is not the person's fault.  Example 2:   A person unknowingly develops a brain tumor.  One day they see some kind of monster in their room and they attack it out of fear for their lives.  Once it's over it turns out that the monster was actually their partner and the person was halucinating due to the tumor.  The person couldn't have done anything to prevent this from happening, so I'd say it doesnt make them a bad person.  &#x200B;  In short.   It's not just about the crime (or other bad deed) but also about the steps that led up to that point.
Please don‚Äôt, I broke down at that point. There was so much death already and then that‚Ä¶
1. Shitty selfish people everywhere.  2. The college and adult education system that requires more money to make money.  3.  Also the greed, ignorance and polarization at capital hill. The human race should be infinitely further than we are today, the planet should be flourishing and we should be safe and probably interstellar traveling and all but no. We killed our planet and each other so the worthless 1% and companies, could enjoy the nice bits of our planet for themselves and it‚Äôs nearly too late to turn it around.

When Jonathan and Skorpan dies in the opening of Brothers Lionheart by Astrid Lindgren. It's pretty dark.  Short summary:  >!In an unnamed Swedish city, ten year-old Karl Lejon has found out that he is going to die from an unspecified pulmonary disease (most likely tuberculosis). His adored big brother, 13-year-old Jonatan, calms him down and tells him that in the afterlife, all men will go to a land known as Nangijala.!<  >!One day, a fire breaks out in the Lejon home. Jonatan takes Karl on his back and jumps out of the house's window to save him, but dies himself in the fall. Karl is crestfallen over his brother's death, until, just before his own demise, he receives a sign which allays his fears of death, and when he wakes again, he finds himself in the Cherry Valley of Nangijala, where he is happily reunited with Jonatan.!<  I did not understand death at all when it was first read to me and boy did it cause an avalanche of questions.
Ellie from Up.   It took a few watches for me to truly appreciate the gem that is Up, because the first 10 minutes wrecks you. I cannot help but think what life will be like when I start losing loved ones as I age. What makes the movie so beautiful is you see this person grieving and struggling to keep going, find connection again. And the continuation cartoon Dug Days is cute as well. Sad Ed Asner passed away.
This could be the opening scene of a movie by Pixar and Disney or a really gruesome horror.

It started with Ma Dong Seok's character but by the time Gong Yu's character died in Train To Busan ,I was crying rivers. I can't choose which one of them affected me more but I still almost come to tears when I think about them.   Another close one would have to be Colonel Erwin Smith from AoT. Absolutely tore me to shreds. Although I was rooting for Armin to stay alive,his death hit me later when the episode eded and I cried in my sister's lap for a good 10 minutes.
This guys just spitting facts
If you take away the lyrics from Sonic and the Secret Rings' Night Palace song, it slaps in an original way. It's unlike anything that I have heard in any game. It sounds like a slow climactic mission and it's definitely my favorite song of the game.
Silent Hill. I never got very far. I wouldn't play it now.
Near the top of my list, too...depressing and beautiful.
I'll mention a few I haven't seen here. Spoilers for Merlin, Rurouni Kenshin Reflections OVA, and Xenogears.  Arthur at the end of Merlin. That one hurts. It also really sucks depending on how you feel about the end of the show.  Kenshin in the not-so-canon OVA Reflection. Even though its technically not canon, just imagining his life going that direction after all he's been through is heartbreaking. üòû Its this reason why this particular OVA is not considered canon, as I believe I remember the creator disagreeing with his death saying that Kenshin had had such a hard life until this point and that he deserves a happy ending.  Kim in Xenogears. Just the thought of his awful offscreen death. Its a good example of don't show, don't tell, but include just enough information that one can come to a gruesome conclusion. After witnessing his wife's murder, he's forced right then and there to seal the lab to protect his daughter for 4000 years from those who want to use her, trapping himself inside in the process and never being seen again, supposedly starving to death, but leaving no trace as to how exactly he died when the party opens the lab 4000 years later.    Makes for a very memorable part of the game when you learn about it in pieces out of sequence, as well. You get to slowly piece together what happened in the past and if you go out of your way to experience the optional content you get way more context than you were initially expecting there'd be.

No. I feel lost and exhausted. You ever have that feeling where you don't want to die, you just want to be in a different and much better situation that the one you're in. Lately, I feel like I'm always holding back my tears. Like I'm always one shitty situation away from completely giving up. At this point, I just want time to stop and let me breathe for a bit.

Huh, that's interesting though because I actually have no problems at all with pronunciation and languages! Maybe there's some sort of correlation there.  I used to read a lot as a kid and as long as I can remember, as long as I'm reading fiction I'm able to immerse myself so deeply that I'm not even seeing the words. It's like my consciousness is floating through the narrative and experiencing it from outside of a physical body. But that only happens when I read fiction and it's still slow.

As an addict myself I find these discussions pointless. Especially seeing people online who haven't experienced addiction talking about them. It's a personal thing that varies.  However, on the other side, I think fame kills celebrities. Sarah Lynn as a character was very transparently an example.

My friend Arthur. Arthur Morgan.   "Ah.. I don't care about all that. Just face me west, so I can watch the sunset and think about all the times we had."

The most commonly used phrase that annoying people that I know use is ‚ÄúWhO AsKeD?‚Äù. This phrase kills an entire conversation either if it‚Äôs in a group or just with one person. It just ruins an entire mood and also jokes that are funny once or twice but then constantly repeated. Just no.
Corruption and everyone just going with it, pretending it doesn't exist because you can't technically prove it.  Why yes, i did get a 500k speaking fee at Goldman Sack's event.

That's gonna be exactly it. FF7R talks a lot about destiny, and I think that Aerith's purpose is to die. The game devs just want to make the old story feel fresh again, but just watch how they're gonna take a little detour to the exact same destination as before.

Don‚Äôt worry it has a happy ending.‚Äù Later as we‚Äôre walking out of the movie, a kid next to us said to her mom, ‚ÄúBut what happened to Littlefoot‚Äôs mommy?‚Äù My brother turned to her and said ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

Every midnight like, at 4:00 am, I hear this screaming sound.  At first, I didn't think much of it. But then, the screaming got louder and louder.  Yesterday night was the loudest. I jolted out of my bed... Looked at my parents and lil sis, and they were all sleeping soundly. Didn't want to disturb them, so I just lay there, Scared to the core. At last, when I looked at the clock it was 5:00 am. FINALLY I COULD SLEEP!!!!!

Born and raised in Ukraine, have lived in Russia for three years now. The things the police does in post soviet countries can't be shaped into words. Those are the exact people that make you lose trust in humanity in general. The only time I felt like police was a benign force was when I lived in Japan for several years. And even then I was acutely aware of what that local police can sometimes do to certain people at interrogations. But then in Japan it was incredibly hard to get in trouble for nothing. Contrary to Ukraine/Russia where it is entirely enough to just be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I ended up special ordering flaked sea salt with iodine to replace the kosher salt I typically cook with, because lockdown meant a lot more home cooked food - and the more scratch cooking with only kosher salt I did, the less opportunity for additional iodine we were getting.   I doubt we were in any danger of malnutrition - we eat plenty of eggs, a fair bit of fish, but even slight underabsorption of iodine has been linked to fatigue and metabolic changes.

Heavy footsteps on the second floor, like they rushing from one room to the other. I went up there to see if there was anyone. All rooms checked and even the attic. No one.  Had some friends over and some of them told me that my roommate should be quieter when walking. I told them I had roommate and I always hear it but since it was creepy but doesn't harm me I just let it.
Well you make valid points. And after all comedy is subjective, can't really tell anyone to laugh at jokes, well maybe if you're dictator, but still doesn't mean they're funny jokes. But for example now the Dave Chappelle special Netflix stuff is everywhere. I'm with Dave, I think he made some good points, made some jokes about stuff, and mainly he told a joke about his, now dead, transgender friend, and I truely truely believe, that she would have laughed at that joke he told. Because like Dave put it, she was a comedian too. I see no limits, usually tough things are told by comedy. That's why we had court jesters. I mean, they went too far sometimes too, but comedy is always pushing the boundaries. "Clean" comedy, is boring comedy. But anyways maybe I'm a too old for this "new world", too jaded and angry. I don't know, but one point I still want to make is summarised pretty well in this clip:    [Stephen Fry on American vs British Comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2AbqTBxao)    I grew up with British comedy, maybe that's the difference, because I hate to say it, but most of the people supporting utter nonsense are from the US...
Late 2000's, I know I could very easily kidnap younger me, don't know what I would do after that, it was a spur of the moment decision. Now I'm tied up in the back of my van talking to myself about the TV show "Lost". Stockholm Syndrome sets in surprisingly fast. I give myself some sound advice, tell myself which friend to ditch, convince myself to make a move on my crush even though I know it will probably end in disaster. No one believes me that I was kidnapped. Make a comment on a askreddit post implying it's all a joke.

I'm blind. Here are some I've used that might not work as well for other people:  "They wanted me to enter a clinical study for a new surgery that might be able to restore my sight. I turned it down, though. It's not worth it if I have to see *you* again."  The other one requires some context. Someone was using me to passive-aggressively send messages to the rest of a group, because they're 'not talking to them anymore'. This went on for a whole year.  Eventually, I said "I've figured out why you only want to talk to me. You must be as ugly on the *outside* as you are on the *inside*! I understand now!

I totaled my car when it lost traction in a very heavy rainstorm, and it wound up spinning around, bouncing between the center cement divider and the guard rail and utility poles on the right shoulder of a highway. Both ends of the car were caved in, as well as the sides, so I had to climb out the window of the car because the doors wouldn't open. The steering wheel was bend backward from when I was holding it so tight when the car hit the pole going backwards. When the next car to arrive from behind finally caught up to me, I was already out of the car, standing on the side of the road, and the driver of that car asked me if the driver of my car was still stuck in the car; when I told him that I was the driver, he said, 'You're kidding, right?'.  Same when the cops and ambulance rolled up. No one could believe that I was able to walk away from it, much less even be alive. The car was a 1981 Pontiac Bonneville. That car saved my life. My only injuries were a sprained wrist and a cracked bone in my foot, but it wasn't even cracked all the way through. I did feel really sore all over when I woke up the next day, though. No air bags back then, only seat/shoulder belts.

I know a guy who legitimately tries to "debate" me on his belief that the Nazi Party were far left.  I call him an idiot and just don't engage anymore but then he sends those cringe Ben Shapiro "facts don't care about your feelings" gifs and it's just so ironic because the only reason he thinks the nazis were leftist is because he's right wing and in his warped mind anything he disagrees with must therefore be left and he will do as much mental gymnastics to make that belief happen.

This isn‚Äôt quite as wild as some of the stories in this thread, but here‚Äôs mine:  My GF in college lived in the same complex as me and we‚Äôd regularly link up. She was into dressing up, living out fantasies, etc. One evening, we decided it would be exciting to have sex on the balcony. The apartment was on the 2nd floor and overlooked a small parking area and then just undeveloped woods behind that, so we did have privacy. We weren‚Äôt trying to get caught, so we had the lights off in the apt as to not be backlit. We do our thing fairly quietly until things start heating up. She kept her moaning down to a minimum but there wasn‚Äôt much we could do about the slap of her shapely cheeks every time I thrust against them. This goes on for a little while until she quietly asks me to finish on her face. We cap off the night, shower and go to bed.  Next day, I see our middle aged neighbor who lives below me. She was a super nice English lady who baked us cookies and always said hello. I say hi and wave as I walk to my car while she is coming the other direction back to the apartments. She looks me straight in the face, with this grin that will forever be etched in my memory‚Ä¶ and says ‚Äúyou and your girlfriend certainly know how to have some fun‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend not taking it outdoors though love cuz I read on my balcony on most nights and there‚Äôs a few folks who walk their dogs by here.‚Äù  Then she smiles, wishes me a good day and walks to her door. I walk to my car in total shock as I realized our sweet, amazing neighbor sat a few feet away while I took the GF to pound town‚Ä¶ she never mentioned it again thankfully.

Be around friends, go to parties, don't hide from everyone and everything. After a while you will start to enjoy things again. When you are able to feel good again you can start trying new things and focusing on stuff you always wanted to do. I personally went back to tafe and met some of the best friends of my life. If you end up wanting another relationship the opportunity will come with the new experiences and new relationships you develop while living your life.
Go on with my life and hope that my country elects an Yogurt as well 2 years later, probably will be better off
My dad works in networking at Wells Fargo. Just before COVID hit an new manager was put into place. This manager basically tried to make everyone come back into the office buildings because it would "improve productivity." They tried this and productivity dropped. Then COVID hit and people had to start working from home again and productivity went back up. The annoying part is there is literally no reason for my dad to go into the office. All the people he works with are in different parts of the US. He would be doing exactly the same thing except he would have to make an hour long commute to and from the office through really bad traffic so it would end up being more than an hour one way. I've seen this manager while my dad was on video calls and he has one of, if not the most, punchable faces I have ever seen.
The NZ one is up there with the UK one I think, maybe even better.

When I would be taken to my dad's workplace, I was left in the breakroom. One of his coworkers left the first season of DragonBall in there and I would constantly watch when I was there.
As an outsider, what do you think of the human race?
I would often give my boyfriend blowjobs or sometimes even have full blown sex in an empty room at school during lunch. His friends and my friends all knew without us saying anything. There was a rumor going around school that we fucked during lunch. We denied it and people believed us. One time the superintendent walked in and we got dressed one second before he saw us. He yelled at us to go class and we never got in trouble. Life goes on. No one knows we fucked in the empty classroom during lunch.  To be fair, that room did have adjustable mood lighting.
That's for proving my point . Now stop wasting oxygen that someone with a functioning brain might need later.
Yeah its quite funny in hindsight that he was just squirming around on the ground. He was also scared of my roommate, a soft-spoken guy that's 5'2, and he'd stop in his tracks if I pointed out that he touched something that belonged to my roommate. Also that ex lied about his hight, which is such a weird thing to lie about. I guess he thought I wouldn't notice because I use a wheelchair? He said he was 6'2 but when standing next to my roommates boyfriend who's actually 6'2 it's clear that somethings off. I don't understand lying about easily verifiable things like that. He'd also lie in a racist, mysoginistic, and homophobic type way that perpetuated some nasty stereotypes. On the internet he constantly makes posts that are like "as a black man I think BLM is evil" and also "I think straight cis white guys are the most oppressed". I found his reddit account while we were dating and he was lying about the severity of my disability or saying that I was dead. Like damn that's low, exaggerating someone else's disability to get sympathy. He'd be saying my legs were "useless" while I was in physical therapy strengthening them lmao. At least I can laugh at all that nonsense   There's no need to feel guilty talking about your own problems. Whatever you are going through, mental or physical is still important, and doesn't become any less important if somebody has it "worse". Anything that's not our baggage almost always seems worse than what we're dealing with because we've become acustom to it.

And I also understand your point. And I agree to an extent. There are assholes everywhere, so there must be asshole landlords. The problem (as always) is a little big more complex. It involves mainly government regulations and taxation. Combine that with people afraid to lose their land, and in need of money, you have the perfect soup to make someone not care about anything, even their tenants.

As a female Punjabi woman, I remember watching her on YouTube growing up and thinking she was great...it was just nice to finally see some representation. Someone pretty popular looking like me. Her videos also back in the day had some good messages, they felt down to earth and genuine. I remember the series of her with her grandad. But as she got bigger I don't know if it was an ego thing? Craving more? Whatever it was, it was her demise. Such a shame, was really rooting for her and her success. Hope she takes a step back and reconsiders her approach

All of a sudden, one of the phones starting ringing and I looked at the caller ID, the call was coming from my other phone which was closed and in my hand.

> The political classes on the left have been playing identity politics  Are they? I haven't seen that.  What I do see is the right literally calling themselves the identitarian movement, and basing all their politics around their imagined white identity.  If any ody is doing identity politics, its the right.   Leftism is literally about not giving a shit about identity and treating everybody equally.  > A Labour mp in the U.K. recently had to apologise for calling Johnson ‚ÄúTory scum.‚Äù  Shame she conceded to right wing cancel culture and apologised. The tories are scum. As evidenced by the policies they enact which always ending up hurting vulnerable people.  Don't enact scummy policies, don't get called scum. Ez pz  > Labour voted in Corbyn who‚Äôs extreme left policies nearly tore the party apart.  Unfortunately most of the UK has been deeply indoctrinated by Murdoch propaganda, which has shifted the Overton window.  Extreme left policies? Half a century ago those policies would have been considerate moderate left wing positions.  > The far left worshipped him but every ordinary person saw him for what he was, a champagne socialist, antisemitic toff  A man that has dedicated his entire life to fighting for what is just, and has never said or done an anti semitic thing.  Again, you're just parroting propaganda.   > the American left  Does not exist, they have a far right party, a centre right corporatism party, and a few liberals mingling around on twitter calling themselves left, and only getting away with it because any actual leftist movement there got assassinated by the fbi decades ago.  If I eat the left Twix, the left half of the other Twix doesn't suddenly become the left one by virtue of its absence.
If you managed to hike out there for shits and giggles don‚Äôt you think someone who needed shelter might be able to hike out there too?   Shockingly, they may have been out there so that people would leave them alone  Or, possibly, maybe it was some other kids who had made themselves a little hideout away from adults. My friends and I certainly did that often enough.

She's only six years older than Hoffman, but was able to play the MILF character a little too well.  Not very well known, but Tim Roth, Garry Oldman, and Richard Dreyfuss in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead.  Hmm. I just realised that all of these actors are white.

I wasn't trying to discount Williams at all, and I acknowledge that he has had a bigger impact than any other movie composer. I was just saying we shouldn't forget that there are lots of other insanely talented composers, many of which most people will recognize music from even if they can't connect the name to the piece.

Or profoundly stupid. Having money, success, acting talent or fame doesn't mean you understand science, don't fall for bullshit or don't be batshit insane or stupid.  As we can observe from the examples of highly educated anti-vaxxers who don't benefit financially from the bullshit they spread.

I love my hair. As a kid I absolutely hated it. I'm black and it is beyond curly. Now I'm an adult and I love having gigantic curly ringlets. I look like a fluffy cloud. And as silly as it sounds (and other black women may not agree with it) but as long as you ask, I really don't mind hair touching. It's flattering! Someone else thinks my hair is magical too! And people usually have the biggest smile after touching my hair.

They're thieves...  I guess what I think about them from a moral perspective depends on the circumstances. If they're stealing food or medicine because they can't afford it in order to take care of the family, I don't support it but I understand it. I think there are social changes that need to happen so they don't have to steal things.   If they're stealing things they don't need (electronics, fashion items, etc.), or they have money but like the thrill of it, they're assholes.

Goodfellas in my ass.   Prison rape trauma survival story.
Watching tv in an apartment that for some reason was all beige, even the couch I was on. I was drinking an orange Fanta when from the hallway a figure that I could only recognize as a demon walks out. It points to me and says "You will die." I take a sip from my drink and it suddenly tastes like blood. Run past the demon, into the bathroom and spit out blood into the sink. I look up into the mirror and I see myself, blood pouring out of my eyes and mouth with a creepy smile on. All the while the demon is laughing.  It was the first time I ever woke up so scared that I started crying.

‚Ä¢Get self-help books. You can get these pretty cheaply secondhand or free at your local library. I have found the series of For Dummies books pretty helpful in this regard. I‚Äôve found the Easy Way to Quit series, designed for smokers seeking to quit smoking, applicable to other situations for habit modification (such as hoarding in my case). And, couples counseling. A lot of the principles from couples counseling are really helpful for your relationship with yourself.  ‚Ä¢There is an online free [course]( https://palousemindfulness.com) in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction available.  ‚Ä¢There are certain over-the-counter options that can act as antidepressants or stress reducers, such as St. John‚Äôs Wort or Olly supplements. If you can see a GP, they might be able to prescribe you medications if a psychiatrist is out of the question. If you can get blood work done, that can reveal if you are deficient in any vitamins that might be affecting your mental state. Taking Vitamin D or B12 supplements can be a boost.  ‚Ä¢Hearing from others‚Äô experiences and how they deal with it themselves.

I'd want a community in a prison. Preferably not with many of the prisoners. We just want the safety of the prison grounds. If not for the governor messing things up, I feel like the prison on The Walking Dead was the most secure place they lived at.  Everyone could lock themselves in a cell at night, so if anyone died in their sleep and rose as a zombie they couldn't eat anyone.  Helping a few zombies in the yard would make people think the place was full of zombies and that would be security from anyone trying to take it over.  There's room for many survivors to stay. So I think it would be a great community, especially if you can treasure mattresses from the surrounding homes. I can't imagine sleeping on those hard as hell bunks without a proper mattress.

Yeah man but, at least for me, it‚Äôs really confusing when you want to talk about a country and you write the name of the entire continent. Obviously you can interpret what it really means but it happens more often than it should. It might be obvious to USA citizens but when you live outside of the USA, and still live in America, it gets confusing, not to mention that it sounds really self centered for a country to respond by the name of an entire continent.

Yes we ocassiaonally do, you have been nothing but condescending and biased. I don't know about you but I am in no set position about this. I have read that lemon juice apparently increases alkaline levels and that's it. This is nothing I care about, nor I apply in my own life.  So let's get the first thing out of the way. I have never talked a single second about any health benefits whatsoever of a alkaline diet. I dont even know why you bring this up? To anybody interested: People that eat alkaline diets are generally healthier, but this seem to be the effect because alkaline food in general seem to be healthier (nuts greens compared to processed food etc.) This does not work from any sorts  of external input of alkaline stuff. This should be clear to anybody. Again this was **never** the point to this conversation. (and probaly what you mean with "wellness blogs" things, but again never something I was talking about nor interested in).  Now let's get to the only thing I mentioned: Does lemon juice react alkaline in our body. To which I found this  Onto lemons and other fruits. They contain mixtures of citric acid cycleintermediates and their conjugate bases (salts of various cations:sodium, potassium, magnesium). The first ionization of citric acid isquite low, with a pKa = 3.2, so the pH of lemon is quite low (2‚Äì3) evenin the mixtures. Nevertheless, combustion of the mixture increases blood pH.  Reference: McGilvery, R. (1979) ‚ÄúBiochemistry: A Functional Approach,‚Äù 2nd Edition (Saunders) pp 760‚Äì1.  I checked in with a friend that studies Biochemie ( a mix of biology and chemie to work in pharma) in masters and she said that this is actually true.

Ha, my company did this exact thing. They sent out an all-employee survey full of leading questions, then hired a consulting firm.  Their conclusions: "Employees want to return to the office because they feel they are more productive there and miss the ability to use the office printer. Also, our company is way behind our industry in returning our workforce to an in-office setting."  Lies, and provable lies. Not a coincidence that people have been quitting in droves.

I mean, honestly I wouldn't be surprised though.  Here in Russia we have such areas in certain cities too, walking there at night is just you begging to be mugged or stabbed, as a woman, worse.  Considering the easy access to firearms in the US, it wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility that there simply are just very dangerous areas in certain US cities (I'm thinking about gang controlled blocks at the periphery of desolate former industrial areas, and basically anywhere more isolated than a main street in the deep south as a person of color).

There are a few 'high adventure' camps around the country, they need seasonal employees and provide 'housing' & board for them  (it's a tent usually & not the best money but still) for a months out of the year.  When I worked at Philmont one of my co-workers said he had signed up specifically cause he had be homeless previously. They can help coordinate travel to an extent, i know for a fact they'll pick their employees up from Albuquerque if you can get there by bus or train somehow. Its a little late in the year at this point for Philmont. but you can get on the internet at a local library and look into some of the other blue sky adventure camps like Seabase and find out when they're open.

When I was in a college dorm my neighbor on one side bought a fairly expensive printer with unsecure wifi. He and the neighbor across from him had beef, and neither knew me. I took a picture of the neighbor he had beef with and wrote "hello neighbor!" in that meme font on it and sent a print queue of 10k copies of it to his printer while he was in class.   Later that night I was walking down the hallway and they were beating the shit out of each other

The amount of "YouTube Kids" videos (videos meant for kids) that are actually adult fetish videos is staggering.       There's videos of people doing "crushing" fetishes on toys with their feet, cars, and heels. Then there's videos of kids swimming in bathing suits but the video is obviously meant to be softcover porn. Flagging these videos does nothing as they are still there weeks after reporting them.      And to make things worse... YouTube will play adult ads within kids videos so sometimes you'll see a trailer for a horror movie or some 60+ minute advertisement which is a pilot of a new show that is meant for adults. YouTube does nothing again.

I work around machinery that can really mess you up if you don't pay attention or understand at least roughly how it works. I'm on a bit of a streak of being around when something goes wrong (not badly, but still wrong) and being able to stop a machine or remove a hazard which has a good chance of breaking the machine if left. They're machines which are commonly left unattended for 20-30 minutes at a time, and every time I catch something, i reflect on the fact that it was idle chance that i saw it, and i wonder how the machines don't break constantly when i walk away. Either I'm just getting lucky, or life is rigged. Dunno which one i find less likely.

Give some CBD flower a chance.  For me, it seems to work better if I smoke it everyday.    Let‚Äôs just get this out of the way:  withdrawal is real - who really cares if it‚Äôs mental or physical?  The person is suffering and that is all that matters.  I have personally experienced withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety (never had an issue with that before I smoked or during smoking - only after cessation), some insomnia (not bad - after day 3 I was fine), mood swings, and sweaty hands associated with the anxiety.  These symptoms are unavoidable and happen every time I stop.    I started smoking CBD flower from Eight Horse Hemp co and it has been night and day.  All of my withdrawal symptoms have been muted and I can finally breathe again.  Clarity is back, motivation is back, and I have a renewed sense of appreciation for life.    Bottom line: withdrawal is real.  Anytime you mess with your endocannabinoid system, be prepared for a backlash.  I will be curious to read all of the research over the next few years about the method of action for cb1 modulation by CBD.  Stay strong everyone and please take care of each other.  Stop arguing - try and feel some empathy for those who are struggling.

That‚Äôs the theory.  I‚Äôve had flus and they were nothing like that sickness.  They burned harder and faster.  This thing stayed with me for weeks.  I had a few coworkers get the flu and test positive and they basically had a few days feeling rough, and then two other coworkers had something similar to what I did and, like me, tested negative for the flu and their doctors were uncertain what it was.  There was definitely something unique about that sickness.  If there hasn‚Äôt been a global pandemic with similar symptoms almost immediately after that started, I would‚Äôve written it off as just a random bad bug.

The vaccine actually makes the child immune to covid because they have the antibodies from the mother. Plus just once the baby is born they are quite fragile so it‚Äôs just much harder to give the child the vaccine on their own
About 3/4 of the way through. I like the story. And how they want you to realize how Abby is basically Ellie. But it‚Äôs hard since I‚Äôve spent so much time with Ellie she‚Äôs like my daughter.

Man thats rough. Do you know if there is something particular in life that brought you into this position, and was there a point where you realized that the money wouldnt be enough?  I know that not spending your money wisely, as well as loosing your job can lead to this. But i also think that the system is broken enough in some countries to fuck you up even tho you did everything correctly.  Im 18 now and working on my first job, and id like to not be in this position in 30 years. I know this is quite the personal question, but do you have any tips/regrets you wish you did differently my age?

The concept of usury dates back millenia. Politicians didn't need to create anything, they needed to relax the laws keeping opportunistic lenders in check. Where ever regulations allow it, high interest loans exist.  All shady politicians needed to do after that was recognize that widely-available, high interest loans provide an attractive alternative to accepting charity in a society where social programs or community assistance is heavily demonized and shamed.  It doesn't take anyone sitting around a table dreaming up a master plan, just opportunism. In Canada, government agencies will give you interest-free loans to prevent evictions or utility shut offs, or to cover medications in an emergency. The process is humiliating and invasive though, with social workers digging through and questioning three months of bank statements to make sure you qualify. Getting grilled over a sandwich you bought on your lunch break 10 weeks before you got sick and fell behind on rent is awful.  Recognizing that people absolutely hate coming hat in hand to social services and would rather take out loans that do incredible damage to their financial stability isn't a big leap - and it doesn't require much action besides failing to regulate predatory behaviour when it presents itself. Make sure regulations favour predatory lending and make it more difficult to declare bankruptcy. At the same time, tighten regulations of social assistance and do nothing to make people aware of the programs which do exist, so people who qualify for assistance might not even realize it.  The end result is the same - programs get used less and signs of mass deprivation, like utility shut offs and evictions, get hidden behind predatory credit until that credit gets exhausted, too. At that point, someone's story is sufficiency tarnished - it's been months since the initial disaster that pushed them to take out the loan and the story goes from "got sick, needed help to stay in their home" or "utility prices meant I couldn't keep my children warm" to "another stupid minimum wage worker taking out payday loans they can't afford because they don't understand interest".

> What you don't understand is transportation of meat is very different from crops.  I fully understand that, what I said was that soy is CURRENTLY an example of a crop being transported worldwide for the sake of animal production. Europe imports a fuckton of soy from, among others, South America.  > Crops are more open to natural damage and it's hard to store it in such a large scale unlike meat  A huge chunk of crops are grown specifically for animal feed, and something like soy is by far consumed primarily by animals. This is something you can easily verify if you actually wanted to.

Apart from the weather? California doesn't get winters like New York. Plus, for white folks there's the different legacy of the 13 colonies versus the pioneers, so that'll impact families for a few generations. Apart from the coastal regions, much of US heartland is fairly rural and people can spread themselves out.
Overpopulation isn't a global problem and in fact population is generally about to decrease in most parts of the world, if not straight up decreasing right now, except in sub-Saharan Africa. Europe, China, Japan, the rest of East Asia, Latin America, they're all near or below 2.4 kids per woman, which is the minimum to keep a stable population. Rising the standard of living and urbanization lowers fertility more in the long term than any catastrophe would.

The whole showing off your bra and g-string undergarment sets is pretty disgusting but leaves little/or much to the imagination of any and all around them (if you're into that sort of fashionable expression of self) Then there are all sorts of things the wearer can fight about being "not their fault" and victimized for having better fashion sense and more maturity than the rest of society who finds their fashion sense senseless, revolting or desperately attention seeking

I did this too. I used some kind of lotion my mum had in the shower to beat my meat and I regreted it for two fucking weeks.

Give your two weeks, and be honest. Most employers will understand your reasoning.
I think that overall I'm more happy and satisfied with life than I ever have been, but I plan on taking it further in this direction.   The reason being that I've taken some bold (for me) leaps and risks that have worked out pretty well because of my hard work and dedication. I'm making my own life and structuring it how I find is best for me and just being able to give myself that ability is something that I never knew I could achieve 5 years ago. The best part is that with the occasional help of some close and trusted friends I have accomplished this current lifestyle pretty much independently and I can truly own that without feeling like a fraud.

That humanity is willing to go primal if it calls for it. Think about it. Fighting over already overpriced toiletries and hygiene products. Damned near killing each other over an article of clothing at Ross (an upscale Goodwill). Greed will take over as well as some would buy the aforementioned products and try to resale them at a higher value than they're worth. Saw this with the jackass in Tennessee who bought all of the sanitizer and soap and took to Amazon to sell them for double what they were worth. Thankfully, state officials caught on to him. We could really go on about this all day.
As a gift?
The thing is it was only good because of the books. The show runners had a part in it but most of the great dialogue and twists were form the books. The author is an excellent novelist as well as being an excellent TV show writer. So much of the dialogue is just copied and pasted from the books    Then even earlier on there were huge plots holes. They were trying to force bad ass scenes too much and did some things that didn't make sense even early on. A foreshadowing of what was to come later  Th show got past the books and that is when it really started getting bad but also the seeds had been laid before.

More people would be comfortable and familiar with eating plant-based food, fewer animals would be bred into existence only to be slaughtered after a life of abuse, less emissions, Hollywood movies would be made about the past animal agriculture industry and kids who grow up in this new world would probably cancel dead people who were complacent with it.

Totally not helping but... just spent over 10k on new teeth.  Absolutely too expensive.  And yet, worth every penny.    I can only guess how much its impacting your life, and even then assume its impacting your life more than you even know.    You can't afford it, but you can't afford not to do it.  Life with the bills is better than life with dental problems.    Search for someone who will do it and find one that will work with you on what monthly payments you can afford.    Again, not helping.  Totally unsolicited advice.  It might be within reach if you want it.

Unsure if extinct, but they'd be rather rare. The number of people who would have a cow as a "pet" are few and far between. They are expensive and need a lot of space, and if you're vegan then by definition you won't profit from the animal. Wild version of both animals are technically another breed/species.  Alternately, I do know people who keep goats and chickens and pets. Though, the ones I know with chickens as pets, do eat the eggs.
Lol yes you can't disprove God but the burden isn't on us to disprove it, it's on you to prove it. It's called burden of proof.  Einstein was from a different time. One quote from one man does not prove anything.   I'm not going to argue with you on this because arguing with religious people over the existence of God is not productive. Believe what you want man.

I mentioned dark souls in response to your assertion that d2r is a ‚Äúhard grind‚Äù. It‚Äôs easier than most modern arpgs.  Logging into a game is annoying and obvious. The server issues I‚Äôm referring to are the lag between actions such as going into a dungeon through a tp in hc mode and being dead before you leave the loading screen. Also enemies not dying when they have no health because of server desync issues, then following you until you reach the next area.  The graphical bugs I‚Äôm referring to are when assets turn into black boxes so it looks like your ice shards are big censored dildos flying across the screen (one of the top posts on /r/diablo_2_resurrected is just that today).  If the game didn‚Äôt run like shit, I‚Äôd still be playing it. I like Diablo 2. I‚Äôm a fan. D2r is just poorly built.

I wanted to be a Viper ( F-16 ) fighter pilot. Too tall though (6'2" max, 6'5"). Engineer and entrepreneur. I'm taking up powered paragliding (PPG) because a private pilot's license is too expensive and time-consuming to stay current.  My stepbro is an F/A-18 Navy pilot, which is sort of annoying.

That doesn't help with the availability peace. My favorite band has had their music on and off of Spotify a ton and some of what I like just isn't there. That does have some to do with liking weird music. But there's a lot of control lost using Spotify in other ways too. Spotify will not play behind Audible for instance. Rocket Player and Poweramp will.
I honestly didn't know parents did this. As a kid/teen I always had friends of the opposite sex and never thought a thing of it. Now my kids also have friends of the opposite gender and it's still a non issue.

Here‚Äôs the thing. I have worked hard. But it‚Äôs okay, I honestly don‚Äôt take my self-worth from angry people on the internet, so think what you want.   If you believe that your ability to get through all of those challenges was solely down to *you*, then I can‚Äôt convince you otherwise. However, I know that no man is an island. No success comes alone. And even you had luck - luck to not get hurt on the job so badly you get fired, luck to not be sick, to have that car keep running, to have jobs that hired you. It‚Äôs okay to acknowledge that hard work also needs that luck to pay off in the way that you‚Äôve experienced. It doesn‚Äôt diminish what you‚Äôve done. It simply acknowledges that if you pull on your own bootstraps, you fall down. That‚Äôs gravity. We are part of a community and success comes from contributions of people around you and before you.   Besides, what good is any form of success if you don‚Äôt have a realistic view of what got you there? And what is the point if you‚Äôre not willing to be thankful for the parts of your successes that had nothing to do with *you*.  Compassion and empathy are free. As is looking up the facts about poverty.   I hope you continue to have good luck to go along with your work.

This may not get seen but I'd really like to be a creative lead on an animated show of my own creation. It's not just small ideas but huge stories and characters. There is at least 4 well thought out shows that could be made with a few smaller one scattered around and a twist that they are all interconnected in a multiverse like creation. The biggest hurdle after money however is that it's all still up in the ole noggin. Not for lack of trying but I can't look at my own writing so I don't put any of it down and what shit doodles I do hardly look like anything. I don't even know if I could get my ideas across to someone who could actually do something with them. So even if I had just enough money to get something going it's highly unlikely a place like Netflix would jump on board with someone with zero history or credibility.  Other then that maybe new teeth, new computer, pay off everything for my parents and get all the work done on their house, a bigger dick, and some caffeine free Dr. Pepper because there is none around me.

Pro tip: only, only, only do it if you don't have an addictive personality.  Can you stop smoking cold turkey? Can you go without drinking for weeks, or control your intake throughout the night? If you have even a vague question of whether or not you're easily addicted to simple pleasures, don't find more. Access is the beginning of a major issue.   Now, I'm not saying go blow down if you don't have an addictive personality, but those of us who don't, have the weird ability to do a line and go about the rest of the night without needing more. It's most definitely the type of substance you want to only do with friends you trust and understand, personally. I always pay attention to people when I'm around it, to see how they act. If it's out at a get together, it becomes obvious who you want to do it with, and who you don't. Obviously you have the television portrayal of people doing it and just going absolutely bonkers, but I've never come across that in the wild. Most people have a much more invigorating conversation, but there's always a couple who tend to hang out around the mirror or plate, waiting for the next line, and they'll get increasingly more aggravated and unhappy the longer you wait. Try to avoid feeding them. They might turn into gremlins.

Buying a wedding dress.   Did get married, but we ended up eloping in regular clothes instead. Originally my dream was to elope, but in a nice dress and all, just avoid all the family drama and expenses. Husband was very "I don't care about getting married, but if we are, it has to be a proper wedding". On one hand he would say to do whatever would make me happy (for a wedding), but then when I found my dream venue, he didn't like it. Lots of back and forth and ended up partially planning 4 different weddings. Eventually got tired of it all and decided that since he didn't care about getting married and we were common law already, why bother. Then suddenly he realized he did want to get married, and agreed to a super simple elopement instead. For perspective, pretty much all of the problems regarding it all was because of his mother meddling and influencing him. She was not at the elopement, and 2 years later, still don't think she's happy about it. The wedding dress hanging in a closet just reminds me of all of that crap, and of the couple grand spent on something I will literally never wear now. But resale would maybe if I'm really lucky get me half my money back, so I'm just holding on to it incase we eventually do pictures or something.
If money isn't a problem, then get someone to do that for you, or don't have a lawn in the first place cuz it's a waste of land, gas, and money.

Do they have to answer 100% honestly?  "Do you love me?"  "Have you lied or betrayed my trust?"  "What future do you see with me?"  If you don't love each other, then it's time to leave. If you are being lied to or your trust is betrayed, then you'll want to know that so you can dump them. If you don't have a future you are wasting your time.

I go to school for PE only, but i was told stories about the 3rd grade sea shell scam. Basically, kids would use shells as currency to buy slime and shit like that. Now, we live in Alabama, so you don‚Äôt just have large collections of shells lying around. Well, a couple of people cracked the code, and realized if you dig deep enough under the swing set, there‚Äôs hundreds of shells. They would sit on the swing sets and use their feet to dig, and then collect the shells and buy slime in bulk. Nobody knew how they did it, and where they were getting the shells, but something fishy was up. Eventually, teachers caught on and shut down the whole thing. If you were caught selling slime or holding shells, you‚Äôd get it confiscated.

This will date me, but my school was an early adopter of 1-to-1 computing, so we all had palm pilots. Now, I had my own already (my dad being a gadget geek) and thus had software that was otherwise forbidden to the masses. Included in this was a nifty program that would use the built in IR transceiver to record remote control signals (you held the remote up to the IR sensor and the program would record the signal it received) that you could then program onto on-screen buttons. Every classroom had a TV in it at this point, and many teachers were lax about the remote controls, so by a month or so into the palm pilots, I had every classroom‚Äôs on/off, volume, and channel controls on my palm pilot.   I only made one sale though (10$, as I recall) - the idiot I sold it to wasn‚Äôt sneaky enough, got caught, and ratted us both out. Alas for what could have been.

I would find a way to help others instead of being forced to look after my own all the time.  I think that would cover it, absolutely.

Mainly logic. Almost all religions are anthropocentric, putting humans above all animals and at the centre of their doctrines. Kinda like when we believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe with the sun revolving around oir planet. And the timing of all major religions is all wrong. On a 4-5 billion year planet, which has only been inhabited by homosapiens for the last 300 thousand years or so, we are stuck with the  major religions that only go back 2020 years - which conveniently keep the power to the elite.

Here in Canada it cost me $4000 altogether, out of which some of it got covered by my benefits from my company. You should look into that especially if there's some coverage for eyeglasses. I could see clearly literally the day after the surgery. Although extra care must be taken for a month. There are a bunch of eyedrops you need to take for the healing as well as maintaining the right amount of moisture. Obviously avoid rubbing your eyes for a month. But man, life changing stuff. The surgery itself only takes a grand total of 20-ish seconds. Most time is spent in waiting between and after the procedures.

Years ago I went to a Halloween party in Hollywood with my GF. One of those fancy ones in a cemetery with a bunch of celebrities. I dressed as Kurt with a big gunshot wound on my head (I know, tasteful), and she dressed as Courtney, carrying around a plastic shotgun.  On our way out we were stopped by a few ppl entering the party. One guy taps his friend and says "look familiar?" The other guy starts laughing. The first guy says "he played with Courtney." the other guy chimes in. "yeah, I lived with her for a while. I definitely think you guys are right."  No, that doesn't prove much. But if you look at the suicide note, it doesn't read like a suicide note until the last four lines, where the handwriting looks significantly different. Plus he had so much heroin in his system he wouldn't have been able to fire the shotgun. And where the shotgun was found Kurt would have had to have pulled the trigger with his toe.   Kurt was incredibly unstable... But I think Courtney was too. A lot of signs point to her involvement in his death. It would not surprise me in the least that she was involved. Maybe not in a brutal, master plan type way, but in a heat of the moment, we're both high, "fuck you you can't quit the best thing we have going right now" type thing.

Funny enough the next time I went I still had to go there since I usually land around 8pm so most places don't close late as these guys (or at least used to - haven't been in two years).

I'm on mobile. Sorry for sh*t format.  So, The ACE family charity basketball game. This sums up what I'm about to type. Family claimed they were going to give $100,000 away for charity, but the funny thing is- All the members on each team were people who were rich and didn't need the 100k for the giveaway.   Nobody could make the 10 shots required to win. What did the host do? Called upon his friend to come down and play. His friend won...  They never gave the 100k away- it was only 75k they gave away. They got clowned online for it lol

A Tesla.  I'm financially okay in most areas, but a real electric car is an expense I can't justify.  While almost all governments around the world acknowledge that reducing emissions from cars is vital to the protection of the environment, after import taxes and VAT, good electric cars just aren't financially viable in most places.  To my knowledge, some Scandinavian countries have completely removed taxes from the import and sales of EVs... And guess what? Suddenly half the population has them and road emissions are right now.  Come on UK. We need better.

Absolutely. But it also points the way to the solution.   Tank the rent market. Don‚Äôt be afraid to move to an area with better housing opportunities. Can your job be done remotely? Are you interested in learning a job that could be done remotely?   Where could you find a job that you could do? Where among those places is housing affordable. The reality is you can‚Äôt afford to NOT own a home. Rent disappears into thin air, mortgage payments, the interest is deducted against your earnings and the rest goes towards equity.   I feel like a lot of my generation is caught up in matching what their parents had. Start small and ghetto. A ‚Äústarter home‚Äù should not be what you want, it should be what you can afford.   The donor class WANT you locked in, they WANT you enslaved. It‚Äôs up to us to refuse to play the game. Cause they get awfully whiny when we do that.   Which is very satisfying.

Higher amount of immigration, this allows the cultural impact of diversity.
I live in MN, the MoA is kind of shit. There's a lot of stores, sure, but 90% of them are just chain stores, and the rest are split between weird one off event locations (there's like a racing simulator store and a flag store and a cheese shop from Wisconsin) and extremely bespoke stores (a really cool hat shop for one).  So it's mostly the same crap you see everywhere else, but it's packed like Disneyland. People walk eight abreast because they don't care about other people and come in massive groups, so as you walk you have to dodge a line of people who refuse to part or walk in smaller groups. People are always stopping to look at shit, talk, or just stand in your way for no fucking reason.   IF you want to sir down, good luck. Nearly every chair was removed for Covid (and there weren't many before it) so you're lucky to find one of the three places to sit down outside of a restaurant/food court. The areas on the main floor and any large open area are filled with a lot of really pushy booth vendors trying to sell you phone cases and stuff.  There's really only like two or three legit fun things there, and those are all places that shouldn't even be in a mall, but a separate location (Camp Snoopy/Nickelodeon Land, the Aquarium, and this weird art gallery/museum/expo venue appendix).  Your best bet for walks are actually the smaller malls in the various suburbs that still have a few stores or going to the gym and getting on a treadmill sadly. Well, during the cold seasons. Spring, Summer, and Fall (all five months) have awesome outdoor walks, bike paths, great shopping arcades, and several zoos and gardens. And our city and state park system kicks so much ass, it ran out of ass to kick and decided to just make the trails even better.

Despite what teachers say, Wikipedia is a good source because of the Citations. While it can be faked, the response time of the self regulation is pretty good, they don't fuck around.  But those citations alone move it firmly out of the "trust me, bro" category associated with all of social media.  That aside I'd say, depending on the topic, databases (scientific or otherwise) that are proven to be checked for accuracy not only in its reporting but into its source materials as well.

After seeing the events of the last 15 years, and seeing literally no efforts on the parts of government to fix any of it, or fight climate change or anything else... I've completely given up on the idea of retirement. I'd rather use the money to make my life more comfortable now, than hand it off to some faceless company that can just gamble it all away with no consequences. I don't expect to survive to retirement age anyway, especially since it will likely be 75+ by the time I reach that age.

Yeah, my son-in-love, I think, feels the connection to his brother through that dog.  I knew my daughter and her family had so much going on, so I was sort of hoping that the spaniel didn't work out, but then I realized it was important for Stephen to keep the dog, so I'm supporting whatever they do.    The dog was getting up at 4:30 am every morning, because that's when hunting would happen, and pacing through the house looking for the late brother.  So, Stephen has been either hunting with the dog, or, on work days, jogging with him for a bit.  My daughter comes home from work, puts their 2 year old in the jogging stroller, and runs with the dog again.  They're willing to do the work, and are an amazing young couple.  Edit for clarity.
I'd say don't do that.   Soda is terrible, and addictive. It has insane amounts of both sugar and caffeine. Both are addicting.   A baby/toddler should never have this. Honestly, the longer you can keep that shit away from your kids, the better. By the time they are preteen, they will likely have soda exposure. The best you can do is never have it in your home, teach your kids that soda is a treat, only to have every once in a while.

What you don't understand is transportation of meat is very different from crops...it's impossible to easily transport it like meat..meat can be grown on almost any condition whereas crops can't be...and if we are gonna import it then it would create a huge economic disaster for some countries, most people would suffer malnutrition... Crops are more open to natural damage and it's hard to store it in such a large scale unlike meat  Also phasing it out would be incredibly hard due to many reasons and 6 years is too short ... Considering the number of animals(aquatic, terrestrial etc) it would take decades, even centuries tbh...   Crops are geography based and gives less energy for the amount eaten.. etc etc.   I understand veganism is nice and everything.... But it's impossible to convert everyone into veganism

Rick. You know the one.
I was nervous, but I also recognized pretty quickly after they were born, the things that I was not even considering at all became the stress points. Pretty much all the things that I was worrying about were a non-issue. The things that were stressful I grew into handling. If you find yourself worrying about the stuff you're worrying about, those things probably won't be an issue. you'll be worried enough about them they'll become part of who you are and you'll do the appropriate things to stay on top of them, so that you don't have to worry. If you're just "willing" to do an honest job of throwing yourself into parenting, willing to be wrong, let go of your ego, and do the best you can, most of it will fall into place. They grow up fast, but when you're just living it everyday, its in your face whats happening and you can't help but step up.
Except if the entire world went Vegan, the demand for Soybeans would rise dramatically.  Just the demand for crops in general would rise, you'd just replace livestock pastures with crop fields.  At most, farm animals would be kept for organic fertilizer. which would also still kind of rise due to the worldwide crop farms.

I am even annoyed by people who can sing singing their hearts out, especially if they do that vocal masturbation shit with highs and lows, I want to punch them in the head. I dont like having to listen to anyone sing without specifically choosing to. If it happens in a movie or a show I will never watch it again. If it happens irl I will go as far away as I can. I can't stand random singing.

I never said you can't feed yourself with plants, we're omnivores so no shit, and I also didn't even fuckin' deny that some plants have the necessary protein we need, I just said there's not enough of variety to supply the entire population of the planet.

Now you see,I think that's really bad for our collective mental health,I think when we listen to a record we turn off to the outside world and just listen to the tracks. When we don't listen to album we fill that space with podcast or news or just people talking and I think that it's slightly stressing us out. Which stresses our podcasters/news readers out,which stresses us out and so forth so I think listing to music is a great escape that we all need but no of us are getting because there no ads in a record. Am I crazy? Does that make sense? What kinda music do you like? If you like Lincoln park may I recommend "dookie - green Day" it's a classic
Same. I freaking hate this reality. Everyone is making funniless ‚Äúmemes‚Äù and getting my pronouns wrong.
Videos were their peak.  There were some great ones in the 80s like Take on Me, or Radio Gaga or Don't Come Round Here No More.  But the 90s took it to another level.

My bigger things I really want are a PS5, and a VR headset, a good one like the Index. So that brings both of those items close to or above 1k, with how rare PS5s are.

I've been bleeding money renting in northern VA and have been dying to move out of the area, but couldn't because of jobs. Now, my mortgage is actually LESS than my rent was.  But for the longest time, it felt like I was trapped in that area because of jobs and spending all of my money on just living/surviving there.

If it looked like a 100% legitimate suicide then there wouldn't be a message with it.  As it is, there's an understanding he could have been killed and presumably people like Maxwell are having second thoughts about what they do and don't say as a result.
Where I live, the color of the occupants of the pink house next door would have more of an impact on the selling price of my house, rather than the color of the house itself.  That, and the house next door is a rental, so it's unlikely that the tenants would be permitted to paint the house.

I go outside and look for wildlife. There are so many creatures on this earth that go on with their lives without the struggles we endure on ourselves. It helps me realize that whatever I am upset about is minimal in the scheme of the universe. It doesn‚Äôt always work but it helps sometimes. Also setting small goals. Instead of saying I‚Äôm going to start running to get into shape I make a deal with myself that I need to get dressed and walk a block. It‚Äôs getting started that usually prevents me from doing things. Small wins can help propel you to bigger ones. Don‚Äôt lose hope my friend. You can do it!

It depends.  Not everyone is tech savvy enough to use Androids.  I work in the industry, and if someone asks me for a suggestion, I steer them toward Apple.  Not because it‚Äôs a bigger commission, it‚Äôs not.  The prime reason is saved data.  I know that customer might break their phone, and I‚Äôm might to have to explain to them later that they lost their pictures and contacts if they take an android, just because the storage isn‚Äôt automatic. The second reason is technical support.  Androids are customizable.  Personally, I love that about them!  But for providing technical support for someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to use their phone,  over the phone, I have no idea how they set up their preferences.  9 times out of 10, neither do they. Personally, I have an Android simply because I like to make my own apps, and Apple won‚Äôt let me do that. All in all, under the LCD, they‚Äôre all just about the same.  Samsung even makes most of Apple‚Äôs micro-chips. This is my PERSONAL opinion, not the opinion of the company that I work for.

I've lived in a country that's in a hybrid where online shopping isn't popular but we still have the internet. It leads to you discovering a book you want to read but nobody sells it (have fun calling stores trying to find the book), and importing stuff is a hassle.  So without the internet it'd be fun, I wouldn't know what I'm missing out on.

That‚Äôs an angry dude.  The funny thing is he could have come up with legitimate arguments on why he disliked the iPhone but instead he went for weird nitpicky things and outright lies.    Like how he says it takes four taps to type in an ellipsis and then has pictures showing it only takes 4 (keyboard switch + period three times).  Also the way he talked about an iPod not actually existing was so weird.  It was super obvious that by calling it an iPod, Jobs meant that you could use iTunes to load music onto your phone (which was an actual selling point back when it came out, even though iTunes is now considered garbage).    I love reading old articles like this.  Dude was so confidently incorrect that it‚Äôs hilarious.

Why are corporations evil right off the bat?  You think every corporation is run by Dr. Evil?  We watch too many movies about corrupt corporations.  Yeah corporations look for profits but that in itself evil.   Though I never hear what about Unions?  They give in the billions every year and not a single peep why is that?  Like my wife is a teacher I read their articles, it is like reading the lefts periodical of how Republicans want to destroy this nation.  Are all teachers Democrats, well no but their members don't get a say on where the 100s of millions are spent only on Democrats.  Strange how when Social Security was created the teachers union were exempt from that and they have their own retirement system that is vastly superior to the current system.  Is that not pay to play politics?  Corrusption is everywhere don't be blinded on only corporations the people who run and the system is corrupt on it's own.

Depends on your country, but it might actually be zero. I knew a guy who founded a school. He had a PhD in philosophy and maybe some business classes, but not anything in the educational department. As far as I know, you just have to adhere to the curriculum if you are a subsidized public schol, but for private schools the rules are even more fluid.
Idk any kid who hasn't always wanted to stay up late eating junk food all night. Of course there's kids out there who wouldn't ever want that but the majority of kids would love that.  Give a child a bag of candy and other junk food at 8 pm and turn on video games. U think most children will give back the junk food and candy and just go to bed? Of course not. They will have a great time and just keep eating the junk food all night until its gone.  This is common knowledge that anyone with common sense should know. Why do you think parents give bedtimes to their kids? Without a routine the child will stay up late every night playing with their toys.

I have those nights sometimes, but as I get older, a good night's rest has become more important, so I don't stay up until 2 or 3 in the that often anymore. I also like to get up early enough to make some breakfast. So I guess those can be considered "doing whatever I want." I miss being able to come home and just play video games for three hours or play my instruments for however long until my mom banged on the door for me to stop. Haha
The average new car payment in America is approximately $560 a month over 6 years. The average new car sold is about $45,000.  Of people making $100k+ in the US, over 10% have zero remaining at the end of the month. They are paycheck to paycheck.  Even back in the 70's/80's, Americans were saving notably less as a percentage of their income compared to Germans, Japanese, Swedes, Brits, etc.  There is a cultural aspect to the lack of savings in America. And whenever it is brought up or criticised, the immediate reaction is to talk about people living at the poverty line. Of course it is going to be impossibly difficult for those people to get ahead, but those aren't the only group in the US. Middle and upper income Americans are woefully bad about savings and retirement too, and I think that is the bigger issue.

"Bro" my partner has ulcerative colitis, which is a pretty common illness. A vegan diet will literally kill them by malnutrition. Clearly you're vegan, that's fine, but not everybody can be. That's also fine. As for "farmers will just farm plant shit", that's not how it works at all. Starting a farm isn't as simple as putting seeds in the ground and making money, especially doing it somewhere that had previously been designated for animal use.

The average Social Security check is like $1,400. Not even close to enough.  Medicare is pretty far from free as well. There's premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. In 2016 (most recent year I found stats for), the average Medicare beneficiary paid $5,500 out of pocket.  55+ communities are cheaper to buy into, but not cheaper to live in. They have high HOA fees and may have move-in fees as well.  Many people who did spend years building retirement savings quickly drain it to pay for health care. Medicare doesn't cover hearing aids, dental care, vision, or long-term care services. Need a home health aid? That's gonna be $4k a month, cash. It doesn't even cover prescriptions unless you buy supplemental coverage! Plus the out-of-pocket Medicare costs.  Poor planning and savings habits are definitely a factor, but when so many Americans have little to no retirement savings  I think we have to look at it as a systemic problem.
You'd think by the 4th or 5th ant they'd figure out they got bamboozled, but I guess hope springs eternal.

Sounds like you need some more time to heal post relationship my dude. Sex is great and all, but only with the right people. Maybe take some more time to yourself and focus on making yourself happy and more secure in yourself, and once you‚Äôve done this you‚Äôll find much more enjoyment in sex and the vulnerability that comes with it.   Wishing you all the best pal! You‚Äôll find someone that makes you even happier than your ex if you continue to know what you want/ like and don‚Äôt give up looking.   Took me till my early 30s to really start enjoying sex. It‚Äôs not a race, it doesn‚Äôt matter what others are doing or where they are. All that matters is you get there. When/ how is irrelevant

Possible unpopular opinion on Reddit: I don't think capitalism is bad at its core. Its not perfect but I think it can be good if done right. I think the problem is unbridled capitalism. No regulation, no compassion, only profit. I guess what I mean is a cross between capitalism and socialism. It is possible to have a capitalistic society and still have social programs, minimal wealth gap, and regulation on investing and monetary wealth. But right now we have capitalism run amok and that is extremely bad and dangerous. Maybe I'm just naive and too optimistic ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm disheartened by how low this is on the list.   As a company they have actively polluted the ENTIRE world knowingly. They are the direct cause of millions of birth defects and premature deaths every year. They not only have harmed the world for the past century but those effects will last another few generations and they don't give a shit. They actively write laws for governments around the world on environmental protections, waste disposal and dumping so they can continue killing the earth.   Fuck I hate DuPont.

Actively working on my flexibility and posture has been a game changer for my quality of life.  Went to see a sports therapist /chiropractor after recurring back issues a while back.  He took one look and said no wonder, I can see your body is crooked standing up - the back pain was a check engine light style warning and not the root issue.  Totally changed up my approach to working out.  Now its more yoga (cant recommend this enough), swimming, walking, variable terrain running, kettlebells than traditional lifting and gym time...which i still do but now am smarter about what i do and how i do it.

I was probably 15 at the time and I was on a date with this girl who was 18 almost 19, she would always bring up very sexual topics but whenever I would ask her if she wanted to do it she said no. We were out one night at Dairy Queen sitting across from each other. She mentioned something sexual and put her foot in my crotch. At first I thought she was just being flirty so I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but her foot stayed there. After about a minute I asked her to stop but she only pressed harder. The interaction of me asking her stop and her giggling and pushing harder went on for a about 5 minutes until her leg was completely extended and was pinned in my seat. Luckily some kid cleaning the floor dropped the mop and the sound startled her. She loosened her leg enough that I could squeeze out of the booth and I bolted out the door just as my parents pulled in. I never told anyone and never spoke to her again. Not the worst story on this thread, but messed me up for a couple months and everything down there was sore for about a week.

Literally read a story about how a man was roofied and handcuffed to a bed. How in the fuck is that a joke? Or how a boy was pushed into the back of a car and was crying and screaming for help? Is that a joke as well? Do those just pale in comparison to the ones you hear the other way around?

Bernie Sander‚Äôs what?
My half sister, who was discovering her sexuality at the age of 12/13. I was 5 or 6. It happened a handful of times, to varying degrees. My parents would go to work and leave us alone and I‚Äôd end up naked and doing stuff I didn‚Äôt quite understand. We never spoke about it, even as adults, despite being very close still.  I kind of just view it as a fucked up thing I‚Äôm sure she regrets and feels ashamed about. I simply didn‚Äôt know any better, either. So we both just, locked it away.   It took me years to even really remember or consider this sexual assault, in part because even now I can‚Äôt say I feel or ever felt ‚Äútraumatized‚Äù by it‚Ä¶ even though I‚Äôm sure it did stuff to my brain/psyche.

We were having sex in highschool. I was about to finish. She wanted to have a kid (at 16) which I didnt know. She poked a hole in the condom. I felt it break. She was on top. I told her to stop because it broke and I was about to. She didnt stop. Nutted. She pretended she was pregnant for like 4 months. I planned to kill myself. It was thankfully fake. I think it counts as assault as I wanted her to stop so I wouldnt be a dad at 16. Im now gay.

I‚Äôm just going to admit what I done, and still feel wrong about. I was molested at age 7-8 when my mom traded me for drugs. I was put in foster care where there was a baby, a little boy age 1. When I was changing his diaper his testicles kept moving and I poked them repeatedly yelling for help. Now that I‚Äôm an adult I still feel disgusting for touching his testicles. My therapist told me I was a child and done nothing wrong, and I shouldn‚Äôt have been taking care of another person at such a young age, but I still feel I was in the wrong bc I touched him. Nobody ever came when I yelled for help and after a couple minutes had passed I just fastened his diaper and never spoke of it again, hoping something wasn‚Äôt seriously wrong with him.

If I remember correctly, many countries responded to that by making laws that absolutely forbid any attempts for any company to step near a maternity ward in an attempt to sell, gift or talk about baby formula, and some countries even forbid using pictures of a mother and/or a baby, or any slogans that would imply the formula is better in any way when advertising or designing baby formula packages.
Because it's not ethical to punish an entire country for the actions of an oppressive regime. Not all people in said country agreed with them.

My point was that multiple similar instances of assault equate to abuse. Assault, generally, refers to a particular instance; a pattern of assaults, from the same perpetrator using the same methods, can be called abuse. So my point was, not only was this person assaulted (once or twice), they were abused.  I agree wholeheartedly that the number of people reporting would go up if more people understood how many experiences constitute assault/abuse/rape/etc.  And I'm sorry to hear about your and your girlfriend's experiences with sexual violence.
Is it possible that your sister was being abused? This doesn‚Äôt change what happened to you but she was very young to be behaving that way.

Ashley Madison.   Affairs have always happened, but it feels like companies are attempting to make it an acceptable social norm. It's people's lives that are being played with - "home wrecking".   If you intend on finding love elsewhere, please end your existing relationship.
Oh got it. I think the taboo or forbidden fruit factor of it is what draws people at a young age. I wonder with it increasingly becoming legal and losing that edge will lower the anount of young people trying it?   A few European countries did this with beer for teenagers. And the amount of young adults who binge drink or couldn't handle alcohol appropriately was lowered.

College after party at the house I rented.  Girl I went as her "date" to a formal just as a friend came into my room and basically just laid in my bed at 2am, and initiated contact shortly after.  I didn't say no or anything, but I didn't want to. I wasn't attracted to her at all.  I'm pretty non-confrontational, and I don't like making people feel bad so I just let it happen.  So I suppose I technically was assaulted, but I don't really harbor bad feelings about her.  The only lingering effect is "This is the type of girl I'm worthy of. So I need to figure out how to lower my preferences of physical attraction."  I've never subscribed to that idea. People like what they like, and that's ok. I don't particularly fit some people's preferences either. But it gets harder and harder every day not to feel like I'm unworthy of someone I'm attracted to.
Not assaulted, but harassed. I was in year 8, so 15 and one of my classmates kept asking me for sex, asking things like how long my penis was, and the occasional touch. I could typically walk away, but she would sometimes follow and/or make it difficult to leave by blocking the way out. It went on for like a month before the school caught on and threatened to expel her.   Not as crazy as some of the other stories here, but i still felt like sharing
Well I'm withholding water until they start growing properly I'm not f****** around with them anymore damn it

It was a female friend. She would find excuses to touch me inappropriately, she was really sneaky about it and used "you are like my little brother" as a cover up. I was naive.

After a wedding my family attended, back at the house my cousins wife and I were the only two left awake. We were watching something and I told her I was going to bed and she came in my room and as I said ‚Äúoh hey what‚Äôs up‚Ä¶‚Äù she kissed me and grabbed my little guy down stairs and then when I told her ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm drunk.‚Äù And the rest of the weekend with the family was very awkward till her and my cousin went home. I was 18-19 and she was like 28-30. That marriage is on the rocks and I never told anyone cause I had no idea what to say and it wasn‚Äôt my place I felt like. Yikes.

Actually, if Billa sold guns you could. Cat C/D require no license. You go to the store, order your gun, wait for three days(cooldown period), collect the gun, you are free to go. If you buy a second hand gun no such cooldown applies. You need to register that gun within 4(?) Weeks either at an arms dealer(eg. Austria Arms) or with the Police. Only a valid "Lichtbildausweis" is required.

Me and my friend were sitting on a train station discussing how messed up it is that the neo-nazi party in our country is becoming so big... A dude in a long coat who had apparently been listening turned to us and asked "You know who the REAL racists are?". When we didn't answer he said "THE COMMUNISTS". We were both at loss and said something like "uh... Okay..." cause we really didn't want to argue with him.  The dude seemed annoyed by our reaction and said "but in the future, we will LAUGH when we kill" and made a dramatic turn, which got even more dramatic by the movement of that long coat of his, and walked away.

Because what they practice is essentially a fringe version of psychology based on a bunch of nonsense. When the medical community, specifically the psychiatric professionals, called him out and attacked his dangerous, unlicensed practices, he basically declared war on them and made it a point for the church to try to discredit and attack the psychiatric community at all opportunities. Their claims about psych meds and psychology are a front, it was actually personal.

Good point.
I wasn't going to post anything because I figured no one would see it anyway, but I've decided to make a throwaway and type it out anyway.   I've had a few different instances, none of them were really what I'd call sexual assault but still some stuff that stick with me in my head.   When I was young me and my brother didn't always get along. He could be quite abusive, physically and emotionally at times and I was always the super nice kid who couldn't hurt and fly and loved him to death. Even though he was younger than me, he for the most part could get away with doing stuff to me and I would have little to no pushback.   We live on a rural property and me and my brother would often go bushwhacking, one time we had a mutual friend over, who was a little older than both of us and clearly had some problems. We had gone out into the woods like we often did, and at one point he and my brother ganged up on me and punched me in the nuts. I was maybe 8 at the time and I don't remember it that well, so I can't remember if it was "playful" or if it was actually like malicious and intended to physically hurt me. Either way I was very uncomfortable with what happen, but I never said anything to anyone because i didn't want my brother to get in trouble. Promptly cut off the older friend though.   Another time again around a similar age, me, my younger brother and my best friend had this game called fort, where we would do just that, go out, find sticks and build a fort. While this was definitely not assault in any form since it was agreed on by all of us (we were immature, unknowing, and probably trying to explore our sexuality somewhat)   Anyway, we would role out certain tasks for eachother to complete and if we didn't complete them correctly there would be a punishment. We'd have to briefly strip off a piece of clothing in front of the others. It would be progressively more and more clothing until we were completely naked and had to stand front and back in front of the other for 3 seconds each. Ultimately all 3 of us did it at some point I believe.   Then the most traumatic of them all was one time when I was a little older. Me and my brother were maybe 11 and 9 or 12 and 10 at the time. We had been living overseas and just flew back to our home country to visit. Me and my brother were staying in one hotel room and my mom and dad in a room across the hall. I really don't remember a lot of the details, I think it started with him daring me to jerk off then and there under the sheets. It ended up that we were both naked and he wanted me to suck his dick. I want to emphasize that I was going along with this and did not feel pressured, the only reason I said no is cuz he could be an ass and I was worried he'd piss in my mouth to fuck with me if I started blowing him. (He didn't know this was why I turned him down) I'm also fairly certain at one point I rubbed my dick against his buttocks but told him I couldn't fit it in cuz there was no space.   It never happened again after that, and we literally never spoke of it again either. We were both young kids who grew up in a conservative christian home and were homeschooled. Neither of us really had any real sex ed, and I honestly think we were both young and curious and wanted to experiment and it got out of hand. Either way I feel a lot of shame from that incident but am so glad it didn't get more intimate because it definitely would've became an elephant in the room if it had. I wonder if he ever thought about it and had the same shame too and just didn't say anything.   Things were also complicated by the fact that I've now come to terms with the fact that I'm bi, so at the time I think I "liked it"/was turned on and never really knew why.   Anyway things got a lot better between me and my brother and we started getting a lot closer as he got older and matured. He ended up helping me through depression and is a big reason why I'm alive today. He committed suicide about a year ago, so there's a lot of intense and complex emotions since we never fully worked through the stuff he did to me when we were little. Anyway, like I said not so much rape or assault or anything but just some stuff that happened that really affected me over the years.
I used Wells Fargo to finance some furniture through Bob's discount furniture. Before I finished paying it off, I allowed a friend to use my account with the understanding that they would pay their share. They always did pay, but Wells Fargo made it impossible to pay towards individual accounts. Got more than 1 account for Bob's furniture with Wells Fargo and want to make a payment? Well, they'll decide exactly where each penny goes without even asking you. And no, there's no way to call in and make payments on specific accounts. I tried. It's like they're living 100 years ago or something. So it was impossible to track how much we were paying, to which accounts, and how much we had left to pay. True nightmare situation

China is not capitalist. Many westerners have had socialism misrepresented to them. In socialist countries.  The Governments invest major means of production and allow private involvement too. Americans think there is .are no private companies in socialism. For instance China would not allow private companies to prospect for oil which is a national resource . The acknowledged that if the allowed privatization only foreign  private companies would be capable of executing them to the detriment of the state. For lesser projects private Chinese companies are allowed.

Nope.  Google, perhaps.  But the data collection by FB is unmatched by reddit.  Reddit has your run of the mill toxicity in anonymity and echo chambers, but they don't collect data and push content at nearly the intensity of Facebook.  Facebook runs data collection scripts on nearly every website and every major app you use.  Social media in general is bad for your mental health, but Facebook is bad for civilization.
I think it's largely based on that generally there is a notion that men can't be raped, so it's harder to come to the conclusion.

She proceeded to force herself on me and rode me until I came and then drove home the same night/morning.   I didn‚Äôt say anything and didn‚Äôt do anything because I couldn‚Äôt imagine fighting her off and waking up my parents. What story would they believe? What about the neighbors or cops? I felt like there was no way to stop it so I just let it happen. Didn‚Äôt realize it was rape until maybe a decade later.

Yeah not a popular opinion, but that whole TLC thing gave a massive cash inflow to a situation where nature should have been left to take it's course a decade ago.  I think the only "family" not being actively criminally exploited on TLC is probably "The Little Couple".   As far as the Duggars are concerned so long as one defines Christianity as "Hamming it up and lining up the next scam/~~revenue generating opportunity~~ in the name of ~~dear old Dad~~/Jesus, they are the most Christian people we know.".  The whole family is fucked, and has a variety of "outputs" from their religious views that are truly demented from sheltering murderous pedophiles to imposing their Handmaid's Tale version of Christianity on pop TV.   And when regular ob/gyn's say, you absolutely should not have another child, your unable you "have a uterine wall that's as thin as paper", and you still swing away, and your kid is "developmentally challenged" as a result, you **can and should** blame the parents for fucking up.  The Duggars are reprehensible people who use the thinnest/thickest veil of religion to impose the wish fulfillment of dear old Jim-Bob.  The best thing that's happened as a result of their celebrity is the exposure and discussion in open forums, exposing the fucked "religious practices" and video evidence that prosecutors can use against them over time.

I have lived with insane guilt from a slightly similar situation. When I was five, I was molested by the son of a family friend. He was 13 and it turns out that he was being molested by an uncle, which is where he learned the things he did to me. Anyway, my mother caught us and took me to a therapist and I was able to understand what happened to me and developed the tools to understand molestation and the warning signs, to always tell an adult, and so on. Fast forward to me being 13 and I would stay over at my uncle‚Äôs house all the time and his kids became like siblings to me. In the car, my little girl cousin started to say something that alarmed me deeply. Later on when we got to their house, I pried for her to tell me what was going on and that she wasn‚Äôt in trouble and so forth (she would have been around seven or eight) and she only confirmed that it was something sexually inappropriate happening to her but wouldn‚Äôt tell me who so I thought it would be best to turn it over to her mom and have her tell her. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt tell my uncle. So I get her mom and I tell the mom that my cousin has something important to tell her and I bow out thinking I had done something great. Years later I find out it was their mom who had been molesting all three of them for years. I basically turned my cousin over to her abuser. It wasn‚Äôt until all three were adults and the mom had passed away (suicide) that it all came out. I asked my cousin for forgiveness much later and she said they were all in a good place and had gone to therapy for years (they are in their thirties now) and that she understands why I did what I did, that she‚Äôs proud to have me as a ‚Äúbrother‚Äù because I was working off of best intentions and that whenever I came over they caught a break because their mom wouldn‚Äôt touch them when I was in the house and so on but I can barely bring myself to think about it and I still feel terrible.

Trans people are human beings, they should never be abused or otherwise mistreated, and I have no problem calling someone whatever pronouns they want out of courtesy.   That being said, I don't think *going along with it* past general politeness is good for anyone. If a person had a mental disorder that caused them to think they are King Henry VIII, I'm not obligated to call that person "Your majesty" or expect all of England to bow at his feet. If a person has depression it's not good to say "I agree, the world sucks and you probably *would* be better if you killed yourself".   You are your biological gender in any way that actually makes a difference. If you need medicine and one will affect men/women differently, your prescription will be based on your biological gender. Also trans women should not compete in women's leagues for any sport where biological men have a physical advantage.
The fact that a majority of the time, your posts don‚Äôt get a lot of upvotes and get buried when they are actually good. Idk why I even bothered to say that because that‚Äôs exactly what will happen to my post here

Couldn't care less. You're a person so I already don't like you based off that fact alone coz I hate people, leave me alone and I leave you alone. Don't expect me to bow down and refer to you as what you want to be referred to as though. And if you try and force me to refer to you by your pronouns outside of what I already grew up with I'm gonna force you to start calling me God and even then I probably still wouldn't call you what you want even if you called me God. I live with a trans couple and get along with them well enough but they don't ask me to refer to them by what they identify as

Was 12. She was 19. She kissed me, full tongue, and kind of groped and felt me up. At a wedding, outside around the back of the venue. Felt very excited/guilty and ashamed all night - like I was gonna get in trouble. Took me years into adulthood to realise it was fucked up.   Apart from that, arse grabbed, cock grabbed, jumped on sexually - like drunk girl heavily pushing herself on you jumped on.   Then there are things done by guys, but that wasn‚Äôt your question.

My husband took Prozac for a short time. He had no difficulty getting erections but it was almost impossible for him to orgasm. We'd go for 3+ hours, until we were both exhausted and sore and chafed, and no orgasm for him, even when he just took over and tried to do it himself. Ended up with blue balls more than once, which was very frustrating for him after more than 3 hours of sex. He ended up switching to Welbutrin (not an SSRI) after a few months because of how much the side effects sucked.
I've found there's no harm in using fingers too. That being said: from a male perspective, consistency, communication, and foreplay.   If you wanna just use the mouth, you have to start by getting her to, well, melt. You have to be really present. Tell her how she makes you feel and what is so intoxicating about her. Loosen her up. If you can make her blush it'll go a lot better for everyone. It's a journey, so start with her neck, lips, collarbone, and make your way down. Gentle kissing, caressing (especially her stomach and hips,) and moaning.  If she's submissive you might need to be more forceful and vocal (with consent.) If she's dominant, she'll tell you what to do.   I don't touch her pussy until I can feel the heat. It's not like a radiator or anything, but when she just starts getting wet that's how you know to focus on her inner thighs and mound. It's the last bit of foreplay, so be sure you don't over tease (unless she likes denial.) Part her legs and get comfortable.   Assuming she's wet, that's your queue to dig in and figure out what works best for her. Which part of the labia does she like licked? Full-length or not? Is she into teasing? Is she overly sensitive? How forceful do you need to be with your licking? Does she want a little suction while you do it? Communication is important, but you gotta show her what her options are.   I like to start by licking up the inner labia toward the clit, and then focusing on progressively more forceful licking. Gentle sucking while licking can be just enough (or maybe too much.) When you find what works it's all about consistency. Keep going and don't stop. Be encouraging with your moans when you can't speak. Show her that it's getting you hot too.    If she likes penetration, fingers can be really helpful. You can also rub her clit when your tongue gets tired.   This post is way too long.

Politicians are people who you choose to be placed into office and are thus accountable to you if they do not perform as intended. You should criticize them if it happens and not place them on a pedestal and defend them at all cost.  Think of it like this, you‚Äôre the hiring manager filling a position for your company. If the person you hired isn‚Äôt performing as expected, you hold them accountable and tell them. You do not defend their shortcomings just because you chose them.

How about by criteria inspired by moneyball‚Äôs ‚Äúwins above replacement?‚Äù  For some companies you can make the argument that if they didn‚Äôt exist, their competition would step in and do about the same thing.  So the criteria would be that the company actively developed and promoted a new product that makes the world worse, and was aware of the harm early in that product‚Äôs lifecycle, and was immoral enough not only to ignore the harms, but to double down on them. By those criteria, I‚Äôd say Purdue Pharma, tobacco companies, and Meta.

If people can‚Äôt be vaccinated because of health issues that doesn‚Äôt mean you should force OTHER people to get a vaccine. If I got the vaccine I could still give these people the virus just like if I didn‚Äôt have the vaccine. So by your logic they might stay home for the rest of their lives even if I AM vaccinated, because they can still easily get the virus if someone that‚Äôs vaccinated gets it.

What is strange point that comes out of nowhere though. It doesn't really make a difference, because you are only attacking one aspect of the problem.

You've killed more animals by using the computer that you typed this post with then you've saved by living a vegan lifestyle.

I've always struggled to take movies or shows seriously when they make high school out to be way deeper than it is. Maybe I'm just one of those bitter old people, but all the most meaningful relationships or events in my life have taken place in at least college age or later. I don't really have anyone that I keep in touch with from high school now.

I‚Äôm not judging you. That‚Äôs perception you‚Äôre putting on it. I am judging what you said and that is really different. You‚Äôre taking it personally (hence being hurt) which is also a really immature way to think about it. It‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs just where you are in life.  Nothing I said is personal. I don‚Äôt know you. You know you. Take it or leave it. But the way you‚Äôre expressing yourself, you have a less than healthy way to think about how humans relate to each other.
I used to get groped by seniors when I was a freshman in highschool. I had a particularly flat butt (tall but very scrawny) and every other day or so these 3 girls would find me after lunch and grab a handful of my boney bottom. They would say demeaning stuff about my figure, put their hands in my pockets and wouldn't stop when I asked.   It got to the point where I would eat lunch in the band room to avoid crossing their paths, which actually turned out great for me, I made a lot of new friends.  I never talk about this experience because even at 22 I just dont know how other guys would see older girls touching my butt as a bad thing. I dont really have any damage from this I dont think, but I now just really don't like people touching my bottom, it makes me feel shamefull. It made playful lockerroom smacks really uncomfy

I had a female friend, we were both in our early 30s, there has been no romantic or sexual level in our friendship whatsoever.  One day we were both invited to a costume party at a common friend and we had an appointment to build our costumes together at my place. It got realy late, we orderd pizza and wanted to get the pieces done, so it became late. I offered her to sleep on the couch in the living room as you would do for a friend.  In the night I wake up because she is in my bed, groping and kissing me and confessing her love. She gets embarrassed when she sees me not responding the way she hoped for. I shove her away and somehow can somewhat confine my anger, disappointment, disgust. I say something along the way *"OK, listen, just go back into the living room and we consider this never happened."*  An hour later, the same thing happens again, I get annoyed and angry as hell, she is falling into this devote, childish  "I'm so sorry, this is so embarrassing, you will never look at me the same as before"* blabla that is obviously just to get reassurance on her side by luring the other to say "It's Ok" , when in fact it is not! I don't take the hook and she left. She left

In the army, my commander (female) had a party at her house, I had too much to drink and we hooked up. After this, she used her position to pressure me into continued sex acts. This digressed until she was essentially messaging me on government computers to things with her at work. Eventually someone else caught on and reported it. I told the truth and provided evidence to investigators‚Ä¶.I was punished and she was given a slap on the wrist. She‚Äôs been promoted since.

And this something people often miss with the USSR as well.  Before that Russia was way behind.  The communist party did horrible things and was obviously corrupt but they quickly turned their nation into an industrial powerhouse and began transforming people's standards of living.

I was bad but not the worst. I poked at her weight, I regret every moment of it. I also was very protective or her though. In my child brain, it was only okay for me to pick on her. When I got married I started my own struggle with weight, we sat down and had a long talk. She told me she loves me and forgives me. Fortunately she made it out with minimal damage. She gets insecure at times and I knows that is my fault. Even though she has forgiven me, I just can‚Äôt forgive myself.
There were no play dates. You yelled "going out to play" or "going riding bikes" and just wandered outside to the nearest park or a centrally located backyard and found your friends. If the kid you were hoping for wasn't there you went and knocked on their door. We'd be gone for hours at a time and completely unreachable.  There wasn't much expectation of like "kid safe" areas - we were expected to keep each other safe wherever we were. For example when we were like 11 we loved playing hide and seek in the state capital building - it's a public government building - and huge with many wings, if nobody found you after like 15ish minutes you went back to the meeting spot. Sometimes we wound find offices left unlocked and snoop them. We would swim in the lake just at any spot not necessarily with a life guard, it wouldn't be considered safe today but it was expected that we would all safety check each other.  If you made real plans with someone to meet up, you were both just trusting that the other would be there. You'd wait around a bit in case the bus was delayed or something but if they weren't there you couldn't call and ask them until you both got home.  There are years and years of my life where there are only 3ish pictures of me: first day of school, birthday, Christmas. I'm still not much for photo documentation - I don't go back and reminisce so what's the point? Either the moment was memorable and then I remember it, or it wasn't memorable so I let it be lost to time.

I was working at a call center a few years ago and I noticed this woman had a thing for me. It wasn't mutual and looking back I should have been more vocal about that. She starts sitting next to me and trying to talk in between calls. One day I'm on a call, mind you there's loads of people around, she starts rubbing my dick under my desk. I didn't know what to do. I was in shock. I didn't want to make a scene so I just pulled away. It's was so gross. I avoided her like the plague after that. She had a kid and I didn't want her kid to suffer so I didn't say anything.

At first I was a loser no body, then I got into making explosives and was for the first time in my life seen by others as somewhat cool and definitely dangerous, however by that point I had a girlfriend and if I broke up with my gf and went after my crush I would cause an absolute hellstorm at school, our friend group would break up. It was bad enough seeing boys fight each other for a girl's heart, swap genders and it would be an absolute nightmare. Plus at that point my crush was already scared of me for the reasons above. I feel like having the relationship naturally die down and then remain single was the only option where blood wouldn't be shed.

I got rapped by my own sister one day after school, she was around 15 and I was 8, I remember doing my homework at school so I could play n64 all day when I get to my house, while I was playing banjo kazooie my mom left the house for 20 minutes to go get my other sister from her cheer practice, not more than 2 minutes passed and my sister started screaming my name, I went to her room and she was in her bed using a dress, she undressed me make her touched her, masturbated with my hand, sucked my privates and made me lay down so she could sat in my penis, I remember being there scared to death until I heard my mom saying were here, it‚Äôs time to eat, my sister put my clothes on and kicked me out of her room, ever since that day I went with my mom everywhere, never stayed at home without her

My thought on him being armed is it shouldn‚Äôt matter. I don‚Äôt know if the gun inspired them to attack him or not, he was legally allowed to possess it. And even if he wasn‚Äôt allowed he was still a person with a gun, they were idiots to try and take it from him. What if he hadn‚Äôt been experienced with it? He could‚Äôve accidentally shot somebody while they wrestled it from his hands. Just give the person with the gun a wide berth. It‚Äôs safer that way

I definitely agree, and there are also different interpretations of what "libertarian" means to different people. Many of the "muh freedoms" "libertarian" no-steppy-snek types are just Republicans who smoke weed, and sometimes are ok with abortion. Many of them are most certainly not pro-LGBTQIA+, because they are stupid and don't fully understand the platform they claim to support.

That's really strange. Part of their core beliefs is that you only succumb to Illnesses if you're "enturbulated" and is a big problem for the higher level OTs who can't admit to even suffering from minor ailments like headaches or cramps. Basically, if say an OT10 gets a headache, they're looking at spending potentially thousands on E-meter auditing to find out what's wrong with them. This allows the church to say that there's a problem in their "scriptures" but they've figured it out and have released a revised edit to the auditing manual so you'll just need to pay another $250,000 to receive the new course and you should be free from all ailments. Rinse and repeat.  So needing vaccination is them admitting the auditing doesn't work and they're vulnerable just like everyone else.
They actually get to explain what the misunderstandings are and everyone is just like 'oh'

Similarly I was working at a summer camp one year. On the weekends we'd all go out to a field. Set up tents and drink. I got blackout drunk and faded in and out to someone making out with me while laying on the ground. People were around me laughing and saying "get up I don't think you want to be there, haha"  Turns out the girl that was making out with me was a girl people knew I really didn't like, and was considered the gross girl around camp. but I couldn't figure out who it was I was kissing. She got me on my feet and brought me to her tent. Took my shoes off for me and and then started giving me a blowjob. The only reason she didn't have her way with me was because I started vomiting. Pulled myself out of the tent and passed out in the middle of the field.  The next day people all gave me shit for hooking up with her. And it was the first time I realized who it was. She went around telling everyone she hooked up with me once we got back to camp. I got real mad at my friends for not getting me out of there since they KNEW I hated this girl.
As bad as Biden has been, I really don't see how you can say Trump was better if you remember how that administration was. He appointed a lot of controversial figures in positions during that administration, corrupt ones such as Steve Bannon, and inexperienced ones such as Omarosa Manigult.  Considering we saw four years of Trump and one of Biden, I think it would be much more fair to make this statement once the first term is complete. Trump, as of right now, and in my opinion, was worse because he helped solidify a division that was already in the process of happening even before he went into politics. He was just the one who lit the match, and the rest followed. In addition to this, the lack of experience and respect for the office really downgraded the prestigiousness it once held after he became a president. But the nail in the coffin for me was his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, that should have and could have been handled much better under any other administration including with George W. Bush.  My issues with Biden are that he has not been active on uniting the country at all. I believe a lot of people voted for Biden assuming he was going to unite us, alleviate the COVID-19 pandemic, and do a much better job than Trump did. I don't believe he is there unfortunately, I rarely ever see him on TV working on uniting the country, his COVID-19 handling so far has been a mixed bag, and it is very possible after four years that he could do a worse job than Trump. And it sucks to say this, because that administration was a low bar, but Joe Biden could possibly do worse.  The only thing about the Biden administration I have been happy with so far is the climate handling, I am glad we are back in the Paris Climate Agreement as we need to care for the environment before it is too late. But that is pretty much where it ends with me. Kamala Harris is the most unprofessional and divisive Vice President in my lifetime to hold that position, and I hope that she never sees the light of day to become a president. Despite my disagreements with Dick Cheney (and there are a lot), at least he was much more experienced and on the eye with his position as Vice President. I believe that Joe Biden made a big mistake with Kamala Harris being selected, and we will see if that mistake will ruin his legacy or not.

Amazon. I have no idea why people trust this company so much but pay attention, they are buying and controlling EVERYTHING.   I had a horrible experience with them years back and still have issues. I had heard of them but had never looked them up, much less try to purchase anything. I like the shopping experience, not a big fan of on-line shopping with anyone.   So one day I was trying to find a small item and did not have time to shop for it and needed quickly. So I dip my toe in to see what everyone loves about it. Pull up amazon and as a new user I go to sign up. Typed in my email and password but it comes back that I have already signed up, needed to log in. Well I am puzzled because I knew for a fact that I had never signed up. I log in and sure enough, there I am but with one small difference, I had been given a nickname. One I never used and would never use. So I go to my account or whatever tab to look up the details on me. The real shocker was finding my debit card! And for shipping information all packages were to be shipped back to an address in Birmingham AL which I am sure was their warehouse and with the nickname on there, an employee would receive my packages. I called repeatedly and reported this but was hung up on every single time. I was not mean when I called because I was scared, mad came shortly after that. I deleted everything off the account, shipping address, debit card etc then I called my bank and had them close that debit card and a new one was sent.   I received an email from them that day that said Bitch.   THEN!!!!  I started receiving hard core pornography emails. How did I know it was Amazon?  Because every single email used the nickname they had assigned me. Then I started getting emails from individuals sending me emails addressed to my nickname, that heard I was into this or that sexual act and wanted to get together. This went on for maybe 7 yrs and to this day, 10 yrs later I get an occasional email.   Check your accounts with them constantly.   Oh, almost forgot this. A client of mine ordered something with her cc from Amazon and had it shipped to me. Her cc was hacked THAT DAY. I do not know how to get in touch with someone honest at that company to report it. I have sent tweets, no response, emails, no response. Called police, nothing they can do. So I tell everyone every chance I get to tell my story.   Be Aware!!

A woman I used to be with would gaslight, physically abuse, and sexually abuse me and would emasculate me if I spoke out. Not being in the mood was ever an option. When I tried to leave she would hurt herself so I stayed. Luckily this finally ended but the occasional run-ins are still bad. (There are a multitude of stories with this)  Another instance which wasn‚Äôt as long lasting: a woman I spoke to at a bar drunkenly forced her way into my rideshare and was pawing at me the entire ride (before this I tried to find her friends and she kept following me around, I tried to help her get a Lyft or Uber which I thought worked) . She then threw a tantrum when I wouldn‚Äôt have sex with her once we arrived at my house, she forced herself on me and proceeded to vomit on my face. She cried then demanded sex. It was a terrible night. I had to clean the vomit that was everywhere while she threw another tantrum. She also refused to let me sleep alone and fondled me until she fell asleep. I wanted to call the police but I doubt they‚Äôd have believed me even if I still had vomit on me.  Those are the most notable instances excluding threatening texts, phone calls, and inappropriate touching from random men and women throughout the years.  A lot of you have truly horrifying stories. Stay strong. It‚Äôs hard to speak out but we should.
I think too fast. Like someone‚Äôs watching tv in my head and their just flipping through channels because they can‚Äôt decide. Smoking slows the channels and they stay in the one channel for a while. Then when the TVs off I don‚Äôt feel anything, I get my emotions and hunger back.

Just hanging out with friends. I don't need alcohol to enjoy being with my friends. Board games, food, good movies, and conversation.
I was 8-9 and my rapist was two years older than me. She made me stick my dick inside her. I want her dead as a result and the last time I saw her in person was at my little brother's funeral. She's someone I was forced to live with and refer to as my sister.  &#x200B;  I'm still in therapy dealing with this trauma and others as well.
Poly vinyl chloride is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
Then what's preventing development then?
Insurance cards, packet of face masks, sunglasses, plastic baggie of emergency cash, pens.
Well, that too. I'm not sure about whether rape has become less of a problem than before or not, rape get's reported more often now than before, so maybe, the overall numbers have decreased, or increased.   Whatever that maybe, the general sexist attitudes persist, leaving a lot more to desired.
Crowder had it done to him. Its not necessarily a deatj sentence. Now, kneeling on someone's neck is an insanely stupid and risky thing to do, and I'd rather not experience it, and anyone who does it is at best a complete idiot. Now, stop getting your panties in a twist and actually read what I'm saying.  If Floyd does not take that fentynol and does not resist arrest, then Floyd likely lives, or dies of an overdose, the result of his own choices. No matter how bad you think Chauvin is, if Floyd had gotten out of his car, put his hands in the air and said "officers, I am having an overdose and need medical attention NOW", then Floyd is being whisked off to hospital before Chauvin ever arrives. And then he can call his lawyer.   Fighting the cops achieves nothing but to put them on edge, put you at risk, and delay your medical treatment. And if you think Chauvin was an evil cop just itching for the opportunity to kill a black guy, then you are a fool to give him that opportunity.  Let's say you are trying to teach your son, maybe even specifically your black son, what to do when he encounters police, whether he's innocent or guilty. Explain to me, briefly, the main things you want him to do in order to get through that encounter safely.  Then think about why the people BLM holds up as martyrs seem to do NONE of the things you'd tell your son or daughter, black or white or Asian or Middle Eastern, to do in order to be safe. Why doesn't BLM tell people what you tell your hypocritical son, if they want to protect him?

Put my life savings into a franchise business. Business takes off, I have one of the fastest growing studios in the franchise, number one in retail sales nation wide‚Ä¶ covid hits business shut down, lost entire investment and now going g through hell with SBA and already settled with landlord.

Slowly being emotionally abused over a period of years and losing my spark and becoming a husk of my former self and very depressed. And then realizing that the one abusing me is the cause and that I don't have to live that way. And then realizing that person is happiest when I'm the most miserable and they don't care about my well being at all.      I now have zero tolerance for manipulation and will cut ties with people who raise red flags. I also refuse to manipulate other people. I don't put on a convincing face with anyone. Some people now see me as slightly cold but that's because I don't want to pretend to be awesome in order to secure friendship. I want an actual long term healthy relationship.

It was because of marching band that I learned to interact a bit weirdly around her sometimes. Her being in position of leadership kinda helped that too. I couldn‚Äôt act ‚Äòchill‚Äô because I had the fear of slipping up with how I really thought about her. If you ever watched the anime _GAMERS!_ and noticed how ridged and military-like Keita Amano acted towards Karen Tendo, it was a bit like that.  Also, I grew more into identifying with the idea of Stormtroopers from _Star Wars_. Faceless soldiers behind uniformly white suits, with strict collective focus of being part of something greater than themselves, ready to do whatever is ordered of them, regardless of personal biases. Whenever the rest of the band was chill, laughing, talking, and interacting, I looked as if I was never called out of ‚Äòattention‚Äô stance. Even while sitting in the bus I sat completely straight and still, going to football games and band competitions, and only stared at the seat in front of me. I was trying to be as robotic-like as I could get when I was with the band. Believing myself to be only a number, and never to stand out (ironically doing the opposite, when I think back to it).

So as a man I had to play along because why not, half way there she suddenly switched to be on top and did a little push on my stomach and that was enough to awaken the monster that was inside me.

That's not always bad. I applied for an Assistant Store Manager job and was told during the phone interview that it was company policy to advertise the open position, but that it was basically already filled by a Team Leader in the store. I was offered the Team Leader position at a better pay rate than what I was currently making. I took the position after an in person interview with the SM and a second with the first ASM and TL that was to be promoted to second ASM. All seemed like great people. Less than 3 months later, ASM #1 got promoted to SM of her own store and I got promoted to her vacant spot. After typing all this, I realize our stories aren't exactly similar, but I took the effort to type it all out anyway so I'm still gonna post it.
Sociopaths, people with ASPD, etc are assholes, it's literally their personality to be an asshole. The definition of anti-social is not some withdrawn but misunderstood poor soul - they don't have the capability to empathise, and therefore they behave offensively, and are cruel.  However, these people are often smart and charming, so it can be really hard to tell. Often they won't be diagnosed ASPD, because they don't actually believe there is anything wrong with them and aren't likely to get a diagnoses. Most prisoners have it, and of course there are different levels of severity.  The kind of traits/behaviours I've noticed in it are a charming personality, cruel to animals, loud, never apologises unless it's manipulative, tries to pit people against each other on sides, spreads rumours, rude/innapropriate, believes they are right when very clearly wrong, believes they are smarter than average (may or may not be true), racist, thrill seeker, money hungry... So many more...  Basically the stereotypical asshole that thinks their shit doesn't stink.

He initiated a secret bombing campaign of Cambodia during the Vietnam war which killed countless civilians andundermined the Cambodian government which allowed the Khmer Rogue led by Pol Pot to come into power and commit genocide on his own people. He supported the 1974 coup in Chile which led to the murder of democratically elected president Salvador Allende who Kissinger and the CIA falsely claimed was a communist, and the installation of fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet. He approved of Indonesia's invasion of East Timor and was indifferent to genocide committed by the Indonesian military.  These are only just a few of the reason's why he should be imprisoned. In short, he is a war criminal who has been directly responsible for the deaths of many civilians and has also not only been complacent in the atrocities committed by other regimes but has willingly supported them if they benefited his interests

>Poutine r√¢p√©e is a traditional Acadian dish that in its most common form consists of a boiled potato dumpling with a pork filling; it is usually prepared with a mixture of grated and mashed potato.  >The origin of the term poutine is unclear, but it might be a bastardisation of "pudding"; r√¢p√©, -e is French for "grated". Therefore, poutine r√¢p√©e could be literally translated as "grated pudding".  Kind of sounds like savoury puddings, like steak and kidney pudding (where the pudding is basically a steamed suet dumpling with a steak and kidney filling)  Therefore, Poutine is probably British! (just explained this to my Canadian wife, who glared at me with daggers until I explained the suet puddings we have, and then she was like, well that makes sense, plus you do hate the French)  Basically Poutine is British!

Puberty.  But it's possible I've always been an asshole.  Now get your shit together and stand up for yourself.  It will be uncomfortable at first but it becomes easier with time, much like anal sex.  Plus, people will notice and most won't be mad at you for it and many will increase their respect for you.    That being said.  It's possible to be kind and conscientious without being, "nice".    Nice, to me, is people pleasing and a way to avoid conflict.  Once I learned to approach conflict with a better framework (actually tackling it head on vs. avoidance behavior) I found that it caused my entire way of thinking to shift.  Instead of finding ways to avoid conflict I found ways to solve problems.

The dealer added stickers I see people driving around annoy me to no end. Like why the fuck do you keep those on people?  I would never buy from a dealer there are so many people selling cars it is just so much more to use a dealer. The problem is not everyone is mechanically inclined and can't properly look over a car where I can. I should make a video on how to do that.

I think it teaches them what the right words look like...I'm not qualified enough to talk about how it is or isn't affecting how and why kids need/use spelling these days. It's just so different from how we all learned without the same technology/internet access.
Does it count if I never really had any intention of buying/using it but the ads cemented it?  Because if so, pick an online casino app commercial. They're the most obnoxious, offputting shit I've ever seen. Especially that irritating twat JB Smoove and the goddamned Caesar's Sportbook ads.
Chicks name was "Shady". She had a really bad obsession sort of issue. refused to leave me alone, stop calling or texting. I couldn't resist the comedy and at that point after being pushed was resigned to having to hurt her feelings a little for her to get the point...     She was pleading and asking me why I didn't call her or text her back more and I said "..Something about you, just seems....Kind of...Shady.."     So, I suppose my actual reason was legit but the reason in her world is going to be that it was because her name was Shady.

It's a stupid quote.  Practice is a thing.  You do something badly, but you keep doing it and eventually you get a different result.  Same with like slot machines or lotto. You keep doing it and eventually you get a different result.

Agreed. I've always said the cartoon style helps SNES games remain ageless, while platforms like the Playstation put too much work into trying to be as photorealistic as possible with the day's technology... Which made a lot of the games age age really terribly.  I'm still playing my SNES mini to this day (our old SNES is at my folks' and I'm not sure it still works sadly).
Pick up basket and rush home. Just infuriating  any naysayers I run into in the garage. Yes, I did bring MORE. No I'm not collecting them.  They aren't just numbers to me they are needs. Wonderful loving and giving needlets (unintelligible baby noises to them)   Screw the car, it's cold dead metal. You worried about hair on it? Be more worried about what I'll do to it if you condemn the precious using it as reason. These guys are alive and they sit where they please. You wanna fight? I'm ready to fight, life pressed the kitten button. That brings out the old me. You never got to meet him baby. That man was a cold blooded killer. Now he's wired to defend kittens and such nicer things. And he'll do so with a mf'ing chainsaw. Ree-ree-ree-ree. Do you accept my ultimatum?  Alright then,know that I love you even more than kittens. Especially when you are being considerate to life. But if you grow wild, just like a tree....ree-ree-ree-ree. Ok, ok....I will put down the chainsaw. What's for supper? Ooh it smells like arsenic soup. You'll have to try harder than that, that won't stop me or my love. Let me just cut us up carrots to go in that soup, sure wish I was still holding a chainsaw.

My mom is the only reason I'm still alive. I've dealt with bouts of depression for years now. When I was younger my mom lost a child at birth and I saw the toll it took on her as a kid.   If it wasn't for seeing my mom in that state and knowing what it would do to her to lose another, I would've taken my life years ago.

Got this from the 'Mentalist' TV show. Get comfortable; make sure the room is dark. Close your eyes. Now, silently count 'one' as you breath in, and 'two' when you breath out. nice and easy. Just concentrate on the nice, slow breathing, and the counting. It's worked for me every time I have trouble getting to sleep.

But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?    And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing!

There‚Äôs no clear cut answer to this. Some people can and some can‚Äôt. It depends on the intensity and time demand of your program/major and also the type of job. I know some people who are able to work more because they actually able to study and get school work done while at their jobs.
Hah!  My husband and I spent the back half of a night out in one of the hustler clubs off of Bourbon a few years ago until it closed for the night and had a great time.  For some reason was an off-night for the club in terms of traffic until super super late, so we wound up hanging out and drinking with several of the girls in between their dances and hustling for private dances.  Met other dancers from other clubs as they came through.  Wound up getting some time with one of the girls BC she was just great company and it was contact and I think longer than it was supposed to go.  That hangover lasted two days. Was really interesting and hilarious to see and hear how it works and what the dancers really thought of things.

I graduated from high school so I dont have around any academic advisor that I know besides in school. Are they expensive much ?   And 3-7 times ? Wow I didnt thought people change their major that much.  I was thinking of being an Interpreter, than idea of being a stewardness came into my mind.Than Japanese Literature.Than now I am contemplating being both an artist and an Interpreter at the same time.  But regardless, I dont want to be "something"' at life.I dont want to fit into a role, I want to be everything I desire and work hard for it.I want to know and see cultures I am interested in, I want to leave a mark on this world that says I was here.
Basically my entire childhood. I learned very early on that the world was not a safe place and the only person I could rely on was myself. Terrified to make a mistake or fail in any way. I'll probably never get married because I always have an eye on the exit so I can leave before I'm left. Definitely never having kids. C-PTSD, depression, anxiety just to name a few.

I don't care about it anymore so I rarely have any flashbacks but I have to admit that it's affected my life significantly. I turned into a shy, reserved person who's afraid to go outside just after I started kindergarten where I met my first bully. I kept on being bullied for the next four years, would develop a school phobia and even start seeing a psychiatrist for that reason when I was 8/9. It's been like almost a decade and I still don't trust people and have troubles creating relationships. I don't think I even care about having friends, it all has turned me into an extreme loner who's completely self-sufficient.

I feel like 3 or 4 people have said this to me actually.   I'm still not really sure on my legal rights regarding it. I'm having enough trouble paying for food now!   It's really horrid. The legal organizations that do compensations for victims are actually legally required to make them take action, yet it's funny how often these things just don't happen. It's taken me 5 years to even get my files from doctors just due to them being withheld so I'm actually up for suggestions but I'm not even sure what can be done at this stage. The paper work for the amendments took 2 years and its months in between acknowledgements from the state or contact between the judicial departments. By that time the actual action that can be taken lapses so I feel really fucked over.   It's a wonder how anyone gets through this system honestly.
What a save!
They're probably used to overcharging some poor fuck with an overworked public defender so he'll take the deal.
Nothing really that bad. My time on this game has been generally positive.
yeah man, brand new cartoons are expensive
My at the time gf was going down on me in the tv room. I heard a muffled meow from the other room, and then another. Didnt think too much of it, my cats get up to things and are quite talkative about it. I called back to the cat, but didnt hear anything back, so we went back to it. A minute later, my cat walks in, proud as can be, with a bird in her mouth. A dead bird really put a damper on the mood. Finding out it was still alive  changed the mood again.
I have trust issues due to being abused for years in a friendship/relationship with a woman who is a sociopath, as well as other past relationship trauma. I don‚Äôt trust anyone except my parents and my closest friends now. Approaching new relationships feels impossible, I can hardly talk to new women in my life without feeling like I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I want a long term relationship with someone who cares about me, and can accept me for who I am, but I‚Äôm afraid of being abused again. I also never want to have kids due to childhood trauma, so my dating pool is rather challenging, since that seems to be a deal-breaker for most people. That, on top of multiple concussions, one very recent, has me at the point where I can hardly remember what I was like 15 years ago. I haven‚Äôt found a new way of living yet, right now it just feels like everything is a foggy spiral.

All of the people here saying Pop-Eyes, I say no more.  Go ahead and tackle a new little business called "Frankie's Nashville Hot Chicken." You will not have a better chicken sandwich, I can assure you.  It's family-owned and they're growing but they absolutely butt-fuck Pop-Eyes for quality. My brother got me on them after making the same claim to which I just shrugged because who gets excited at that sort of news(?)  Anyways, yea, I was blown away. Like *blown away*. I thought Mary Browns was the shit but thiiiiiiis is THUH SHIT.
My childhood friend hector, he'd go to Mexico to visit family alot n bring back a big ass bag of these suckers. The suckers or lollipops are covered in chilli and they are in the shape of corn, mangos n watermelon

Caitlyn Jenner probably shouldn‚Äôt be behind bars unless you put everyone who has an accident behind bars.  There was no evidence she committed a crime based on the statement of the district attorney.  They did find that she applied her breaks and that she was driving below the speed limit.  She also was sober.  She was towing an ATV and likely thought she‚Äôd be able to stop sooner than she could, a simple accident.   https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/05/13/did-caitlyn-jenner-kill-someone-get-released-district-attorney/5072816001/

what a way to die
It's 7:30.
Every single night I think about how tomorrow is finally going to be the day I get the courage to end my life so I'll be free of the nightmares that I see both in my sleep and everyday life. That I'll finally do what I want instead of just doing what everyone else wants me to do because they think it's the only way. Then I won't have to care about the hypocrisy of having people say I'm the irrational when they act just as irrationally by saying I'm wrong to feel the pain I do. The pain I feel when I see the smartest species we'll ever live to see kills itself slowly for pursuits of the self and not pursuits for the whole. For pursuits meant to fill delusions of grandeur. I think of finally escaping from an existence where the young and smart are expected to fix everything so those before us don't have accept fault where it's due. Every night that's what I think about as I dread sleeping because even then there is no reprieve. Every time it's nightmares about how I don't have the resources or the charisma to help mold the world so we stop wasting ourselves on bullshit so we can all go back to being human and not just a bunch of robots that weren't given processes to follow so we wonder aimlessly trying to impersonate what we all are. I think of dread and suffering and how no matter what I do I'll always be a nameless face that no one will listen to because we can no longer trust those who want to help.

What you say doesn't make much sense. The prohibition towards minors has been in place for decades with cigarettes, a simple flavoring wouldn't make anyone think that cigarettes are in anyway more suitable to minors than before. It still falls to the judgement of the vendor to sell or not sell to minors, just as it happens with alcohol. (In EU underage drinking is way more of a problem than underage smoking BTW)  Let's just face it, Phillip Morris is losing a huge chunk of earnings to vaping and that's what stings. Most people I know that vape now, used to be smokers and vaping helped them reduce or cut entirely their smoking habit, me included.

I'm okay with it. I've done it before and I'm sure I'll do it again. If someone is insufferable and I just can't reason with them I just don't reply and if I have to, block them. It's annoying and stressful. I don't want to spend my time arguing with people. Once in a while is one thing but I don't want to deal with a constant battle. I've been ghosted a few times too. I'm cool with that. I'm not a person who doesn't take rejection well and I don't talk to people who don't want to talk to me so it's fine. They probably just got tired of my shit, which is fair. I can understand that.       There are good reasons to do it. I know some people get extremely offended by it and they tend to get very very angry when I say it but there are more important things than your sensitive feelings. A lot of women feel like if they reject men they'll do something crazy. A lot of people have anxiety and it's very difficult to have that conversation. And a lot of people are just sick of your shit and they would rather just not. All valid reasons and all things you should get over. It's not the end of civilization. You'll be fine.

The bullying I experienced was mostly just being excluded from things. For example I'd try to join a game and everyone would be shitty to me until I left.

Silver lining: I'm very comfortable with my own company and don't generally get lonely

>Especially when the situation was based on an actual war of separatists in Ukraine at Donetsk.  Do you have a link on that?  I've been thinking that this was just a cruel yet clever plot line. Makarov knows there's a CIA spy among his men. So, he does the killing, then shoots CIA guy and leaves his body there. When investigation starts, they have witnesses who only heard attackers speak English and a single corpse of an attacker who turns out to be a CIA agent.  This is more than sufficient as a declaration of war. And remember that tech stuff you were trying to steal in the winter mission? Yeah, they managed to copy it before you stole it. So, not only Russia feels the need to retaliate, it also has an upper hand in the conflict.  This Makarov guy is a fucking mastermind if you ask me.

Yes to 90% of this reply. However many on the right do not call her a freak. They invite and applaud her at cpac. The right simply take issue with the left's attitude of intellectual elitism (displayed in this reply by calling conservative views shit), and the left saying they are the party of science in one sentance and then saying things like men can get pregnant in the next. It has nothing to do with trans people on individual levels at all. They take issue with woke statements clashing with basic science. Of the 6 or 7 trans individuals I know, they actually find the left to be insufferable for being offended on behalf of them. Most trans individuals ive encountered tend to lean libertarian, which means by proxy they tend to lean more moderate than far left.

Not about me but I once woke up cause my roommate was having a conversation in the bathroom with his date and I was kinda grossed out. I heard them saying:  "Wooow look, and all over your face. That's so nasty"  "It's all over your face as well!"  They were laughing as well. I knew they had sex because it was a very noisy house. And I was like jeez, you don't have to be so proud of that accomplishments and admire it. Just get on with the sex together...  The next morning his date was away and I asked at the breakfast table what they were having fun about in the bathroom. Well apparently they kissing eachother in the dark, and my roommate got a nose bleed. However they didn't notice it because it was dark, and eventually they felt something was weird and they went to the bathroom to check. Their whole faces were painted red lol.

Sorry you went through that, man. It sounds like you‚Äôre in a nasty divorce, and the battle for custody can get especially dirty and fucked up.  The dangerous part of your initial statement is that it could A. Lead people who witness or suspect abuse to be less likely to report it (because most people don‚Äôt wake up in the morning stoked to ruin others‚Äô lives), and B. Make families who need support less likely to accept it out of fear of having their kids ripped away from them.  Similar to your experience with your comment, my comments aren‚Äôt hypothetical. They‚Äôre things mandated reporters see and struggle against regularly. You have very specific goggles on right now, but your challenge lies more in custody / divorce procedures than in the ways Child (and Adult) Protective Services typically operates.

Pardon my subpar explanation; I was mostly thinking about social and cultural constructs, in example how both are viewed as "overly apologetic" or nice, not traditional customs!  I think many of us view Canadians as friendly, warm and helpful, something we hope to see in our self!  Norway is a quite small country, but a large part of the population tends to care about international affairs, and Canadian politics are often viewed as closer to "our" or European mindset, which sadly sometimes is used in contrast to what is happening in the US.

WTF even is a villa?
"The wind is howling"
I hate to sound super depressing here, but it‚Äôs my life and i‚Äôve accepted it now. This is probably gonna be long.  My mom died when i was 8. She had gone partying with a new group of friends. They had smoked weed, and drank a lot of alcohol. They decided to go on an ATV ride around 2-3 in the morning. The guy driving was nearly blackout drunk and wanted to impress my mom, so he was going around 50-60 on a gravel road. When a sharp corner came there was only one outcome.  I don‚Äôt know the extent of her injuries but i know that she had hit a tree mid air and i believe she was dead on scene. It really sucked because the night it happened, i remember crying and pulling on her jacket for her not to leave‚Ä¶ She had done this so many times before but i just had to throw a tantrum. She definitely was an alcoholic, and definitely wasn‚Äôt a perfect mother, but she was perfect in my eyes, because i didn‚Äôt understand any of those things when i was little.  Her funeral sucked. A lot. I was completely numb. As a child, it was hard to process such a catastrophic event especially without grieving properly‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even cry at her funeral. It makes me feel terrible to this day. I remember it so clearly yet i‚Äôve forgotten her voice.  Her funeral was also the day i met my dad. You see, my dad left my mom when i was 9 months old because they were having issues and her dad had threatened him in the woods. Mind you, this is in the STICKS. Anyways, I met my dad, his girlfriend had come with. My new mom. I remember him giving me a pink teddy bear, which i creatively named sprinkles. I don‚Äôt remember much after that.  This affected me in a lot of ways. First of all, my two sisters and i had to go through a court process of where we were going to be placed. In the meantime we stayed at our great aunt and uncles‚Äô. It didn‚Äôt last long. My oldest sister wanted to live with our moms friend, but ended up in a group home. Our middle sister met her dad for the first time as well, and liked him until he started becoming mentally abusive. I stayed with my aunt and uncle, who actually had a really nice place.  And then my dad got custody. Supposedly, my aunt has hissed at my dad in the courtroom ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not taking her‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt a good start to keeping my connection to my family. I now no longer have my sisters. Except the new baby my dad just had. I moved back with them 6 hours south, in wisconsin. Naturally, my dad was also an alcoholic with severe mental issues. He didn‚Äôt like any of my family ‚Äúup north‚Äù except my grandma. Which meant i would go multiple years without seeing them on account of something i had done‚Ä¶ like bad grades, or lying. Did i mention my dad was a marine? My dad is a huge guy. at one point 300lbs. He‚Äôs scary. And he yells, very loud. You see, as I got older I don‚Äôt think we ever had a good relationship. I was a very depressed child. My dad reminded me countless times of how i would walk alone at recess along the fence‚Ä¶ repeatedly. He would use it against me, like it was weird. Anything i did was nitpicked, if i didn‚Äôt make my bed i was a pig, if i would try to put on makeup, i was doing it for attention, but the reality was, I was fucked up. His onslaught of ‚Äúmarine corps‚Äù parenting, misogyny, narcissism, made itself more apparent the older and more defiant i got. Until i turned 18.  I had met a guy, my current boyfriend. It was the end of homecoming week, so we were let out of school early. I decided to go with him to get little caesar‚Äôs and eat it at his house (the rest is well, you know, i was a teenager). The thing is, i usually take the bus. Which i thought would be easily solved by him dropping me off directly behind the bus stop so i could walk with my siblings up a block to our house. My dad did NOT like that. He stated that clearly, by obviously yelling and taking my phone. That was always his solution. To take my phone. and comb through it. I had learned to just delete social media i actually used. Strict parents really DO make sneaky kids.  Anyways, this, among other reasons, made me decide to move in with my boyfriend when i graduated, well a few months after. My dad had pestered me to either go to college or move out. So i moved out. It really hurt me‚Ä¶ especially since my best friend had actually been instigating him by saying my bf was a bad influence, but she was actually mad because i was spending more time with him. I ghosted everyone. Everyone except my family up north. I needed to see them, so i took my boyfriend up north and he met them. This end part has been grossly summarized, as i feel i‚Äôve taken. enough of your time, but i hope you sympathized (or enjoyed) the series of unfortunate events that is my life. I could‚Äôve added more and feel free to ask questions? or give advice. It‚Äôs now 3;09 am. goodnight.

On his deathbed my grandfather admitted he had a previous family before he married my grandmother and she made him swear to never tell their children about it. She had passed years before and something with how grandfather's will was written meant the abandoned children could have some claim to inheritance so he was warning us about that but given he had the will written that way I get the impression he had carried guilt about it his entire life and needed to "confess".

&#x200B;  few months ago,i would sneak out of the house to go on a walk around town and pay visits to parks there at late nights, just a girl walking around the city with a hoodie, definitely not a drug dealer, i was returning back home, and my dumbass chose to go short cut through a dirth road on the "ghetto" side of the twon, like unfinished roads, trees every where around broken cars, old ass buildings yk the drill it was creepy. asf while i was walking there i came across a dog, i didn't think much of it, thinking it was normal there is a lot of stray dogs in this area after all but, it kept looking at me staying still in his place, i was confused yet thinking he was going to attack me but i stayed  calm thinkinng  &#x200B;  "if i dont react he wont do shit, just stay calm"  that "dog" dead ass made me have shivers like seriously it was fully black and i can barly see its eyes, but i knew he was looking at me , and then my fucking skin craweld, the dog slowly got on its back legs standing just like a human would  do.  thoughts where running in my mind like wtf is he doing or oh shit this might be a skin walker or something, it just KEPT STAYING FUCKING STILL   i kept quite still fucking scared, i then start slowly walking around it and went back to walking and picked up my speed and start walking faster idk what this thing is i dont even know what it will do i become far away enough, i turned around and it fucking disappeared and no sings of it being nothing  i toke another road back home, litreally regereting my choise of going there, never went back to that road/area again

We went to a Japanese restaurant in Hawaii. My son was 3 and couldn't sit still so after ordering we walked around the plaza.  My wife is Asian and has really opened me up to new foods. Back home we would get Udon soup. This restaurant had that, but it also had other dishes with Udon noodles. I ordered one of these.  I returned to the restaurant with my son after about 15 minutes. Our food was there, but they had brought me Udon soup. I complained to my wife, and started to flag down the waitress, but my wife stopped me and insisted that I eat the soup.  After we left and were driving away she told me what happened. They brought out the noodle dish, and my wife told the waitress it was the wrong dish. She said that I had meant to order the soup. Things escalated and she ended up arguing with the manager about it, so they swapped it out. My wife was embarrassed, and we did not go back to that restaurant.

Early in my career. Perhaps at the age of 17? My father was out of town and I was drinking from a bottle of vodka and going down on a girl on the living room couch. I was down there doing my work and I noticed she was really ..."hydrated"... down there, like more than normal...But I was drunk and didn't think anything of it..  I had wiped my chin on my arm a couple times and had both my hands on her thighs and my eyes had been closed for some time before I opened them just far enough to make out there was some sort of markings on my hand! I opened my eyes more and tried to focus my blurry drunk eyes on what it could have possibly been when I noticed a PUDDLE..and I mean PUDDLE of blood was underneath her, all down my arm, all down my chest- of course all over my face.  It looked like a murder scene. She ran into the bathroom and took a shower. I cleaned up the mess as best I could (It wasn't good at all, I was drunk, most of it was flipping the cushions.)

Advice to people who want to help the kid:    Do not say ANYTHING to the parents unless you can get the kid out of that situation *right now*   I learned to distrust authority figures because when I asked for help, they made things so much worse. Any time teachers contacted my parents with concerns, *I* would get punished for ‚Äúwasting the teachers time‚Äù or ‚Äúlying about being abused‚Äù or ‚Äútrying to rip apart this family‚Äù   It made me very good at hiding the fact that I was being abused and neglected.

something similar happened to me. my mom and father fought a lot so one day while they were having a pretty bad argument in the car my mom suddenly yelled at me to turn off the music on my gameboy advance, so i did‚Ä¶ and i just never turned it back on. i even remember the game i was playing (pokemon crystal). to this day i still play a lot of games without any sound on; my switch and 3DS always have the volume turned off and even for PC games i‚Äôll either disable everything or set it very low.  probably not my weirdest habit and not something i consider particularly traumatizing (i was already used to them having those kinds of fights and taking it out on me) but definitely one of the silliest imo.

I‚Ä¶you‚Ä¶ Just really made something make a LOT of sense!    Going to also get personal and graphic here for a moment but, I have a small vagina and while I do enjoy men who are blessed I would avoid having sex with them if they were TOO blessed.  Getting put in positions where they would try to punch my throat through my vagina would always leave me feeling so cramped up I thought I was broken.  Would have to lay in bed with a heating pad in a fetal position for several hours then take a hot bath just to start feeling normal again.  Like major ‚Äúlighting butt‚Äù (women know) and everything.    I‚Äôve had my cervix and uterus removed and have been terrified to have sex with any man who is above average out of fear that they‚Äôll punch through my vagina and literally start rearranging my guts.  Haha  But uhmmmm‚Ä¶now also I want to know if I‚Äôll still get that false labor feeling now that I am missing parts.  Thanks for inspiring my new bedroom experiment project.  Since we‚Äôre sharing awkward sex moments:  mine was having a TV fall on my head.  My ex husband and I were newly dating, I had one of those cheap plastic drawer storage things next to my bed that had my TV on it.  We had moved the bed enough while fucking that it was bumping against that and the TV fell off right onto my head.  ‚Ä¶He didn‚Äôt stop fucking me and I couldn‚Äôt decide if I should laugh, cry or just pretend that there wasn‚Äôt a TV where my head should be.  Haha  It was one of those older style TVs that were boxy and had some weight & not like a modern, slim type so it had heft.  He was clearly ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù because he was shocked post nut to see the TV on the bed next to us and more shocked when I said it had fallen on my head.   (Hindsight:  should have been a wailing siren of a red flag).

Mostly living with my abusive father as an only child after my parents divorce really hardened me. My dad was a heartless person during them times and my mom didn't want to take me because I used to lash out with her and the school official which made me end up in special education, after all that's how I was raised my father used to overreact, yell and beat everyday and school and my mom's was the only place we're I can express myself emotionally and that's the only way I knew. Though for my father it's like he never let go of being in prison. At his house I used to have to sleep on a mattress in the same room as him because the other rooms in his house are rented. Now imagine living in the same room as your abusive father!! Absolute hell. I dreaded each day because each day was the same, even going to the grocery store was a treat. I used to have to watch my tone change the way I interact with him to stay on his good side with him EVERYDAY I never ever had I had a sense to output being myself emotionally. A lot of emotional battles and physical battles I went through for what seems like years but the past isn't too far away as I realise it is recent. but now praise be to god I'm with my mom's and it feels like retirement!!! I'm not lashing out anymore compared to me being a kid with her. I don't blame my mom as she was just trying to survive and I made life hard for her and now I just want to make her proud. What disturbs me through this time is I feel broken I and I can't explain it some things inside me aren't right. I wish I could share my story sometimes I wish I had friends but I hate friends because I used to have neighborhood friends that would manipulate me and peer pressure me and treat me like shit you know. I can't trust people. I feel like everyone always judging me and i just can't do nothing right. Fuck all of this

Don‚Äôt expect expect anything from anyone. Look inward. Expect the best from yourself. Raise your standards in regards to how you treat others, since you have no power over how others act.   When you do come across people who are well mannered and reasonable you will appreciate them more for their character.   Once again you can avoid expecting the worse from people when you expect nothing. When you think like this you will be overjoyed when they do right by you, and you won‚Äôt be disappointed but rather, informed when/if they you do you dirty. It may hurt a little but it‚Äôs out of your hands.
You should feel sorry for your mom.

My parents worked constantly when I was younger and would leave me and sister with multiple babysitters. I had attachment issues and would cry if I was separated from my mother. I'm not exactly sure when this happened but my mother did tell me she was stuck for at least half a year in Mexico after having to take me back to Mexico for medical reasons (I was born in the U.S., allowing me the opportunity to be a citizen while she was and still is an immigrant) Well one day, after leaving for work, I start crying non-stop and the babysitter had enough of that and told me if I didn't stop crying, my mother would never come back. After hearing this, I cried even more to the point that I starting vomiting til I had nothing left in my stomach. After that incident, whenever my mother left my sight, I would panic because of the irrational fear that was created by the babysitter and start to cry and vomit. It got to the point where the fear morphed into anxiety and I would cry and vomit whenever I was anxious or nervous. To this day, I still vomit when I'm anxious regardless of the situation. I am 27 now and still have to find ways to control my anxiety without vomiting. It's gotten to the point where I refuse to eat if I know I'm going to be in a situation that will make me anxious/nervous.

This is for the record. History is written by the victor.  History is filled with liars.  If¬†he¬†lives, and we die, his truth becomes written - and ours is lost.  Shepherd will be a hero, 'cause all you need to change the world is one good lie and a river of blood. He's about to complete the greatest trick a liar ever played on history.  His truth will be the truth.  But only if he lives, and we die. The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is its last day on Earth.  But I think that's a luxury, not a curse.  To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom. Good time to take, inventory. Out-gunned, outnumbered, out of our minds.  On a suicide mission.  But the sand and the rocks here, stained with thousands of years of warfare, they will remember us, for this.  Because out of all our vast array of nightmares, this is the one we choose for ourselves.  We go forward like a breath exhaled from the Earth. With vigor in our hearts and one goal in sight: We. Will. Kill¬†him.

About 15 or so years ago when I was working in retail I was driving to work one early morning around Halloween. I made it to a T-junction and I was about to make a left turn. There was a long driveway in front of me and a mailbox. Right next to the mailbox on a chair was sitting a very, very old wrinkled woman dressed in all black. I mean, she looked ancient and somehow not human like. She gave me a very menacing look as I looked at her while stopping at the sign.   It gave me very creepy vibes and to this day I'm not sure if it was an actual person or Halloween decoration.  I just bailed out of there as fast as I could. I took an alternative route to work the next several days.

Knowing the exact right time to do something, like when to leave the office to get home at a certain time, when the steak is perfectly done, or when to look outside to see the neighbor suntanning nude.
This seems easy and good in theory, but most of the times it just turns into a session of asking a bunch of random stuff and getting nowhere, like you're staying on surface level. I don't understand how to make conversations flow. Normal people will ask something and then naturally flow into another thing etc. For me it's more like "oh so you went to school there? Oh and did you enjoy university? Oh and what's your dog's name? Did you see that it's going to rain tomorrow? Cool nice to meet you!"

I was once camping on a beach in Northern Colombia in the middle of nowhere and once it got dark the water started glowing wherever it was disturbed.

I do not want to cry those tears anymore, it hurts too much ! I find it difficult to let go of things.  I think I am attachment dysfunctional or something.    Yes, I like breakfast for sure ! I will make some bacon, hashbrowns and eggs with some tea ! And I am NOT gonna share it with some strangers !    Soo I guess I will get my defenses ready to push away these awful people.

Lol precisely.

Sorry, dudes. Work on your self-confidence first, the more sure you are of yourself, the easier you'll find to be funny and approachable. It's not unattainable, it just takes a bit of reflection and work. And humility, I guess.

I guess I also try to stay hungry cause hunger is supposedly a more basic instinct than feeling pain, so when you are starving you don't notice pain as much.

He has Asperger's according to his dad. I had told them many times we can take him to a therapist as I have seen much worst kids than him who don't show any of those issues as they grew up, but his dad never takes him (which is very suspicious). He used to volunteer at a cafe when he was in school, so I don't think he has the 'shyness' his dad states he has and I have never seen it when we are in social groups, he is much less shy than me actually. And in the job he would have applied for, you could state your disability and they will put you in a position where it suits you best. He had applied for benefits and it was rejected as they found him fit to work several years back. There is a lot of laziness, you need to keep pushing him to even clean his room and then also he won't. His dad raised him himself since he was born, and did everything for him, and still cooks his dinner and knocks on his door, if dad is at work he doesn't even make anything himself and eat!

Don‚Äôt put on a role for me. You don‚Äôt need to act or put on a show to boost my manliness. I‚Äôd much rather be present with you and if whatever we‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt doing it for you, lets play around and find something thats better. Sex doesnt need to be that serious, it can be, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be. It‚Äôs not a show, it can be fun and it can be a whole lot of things. Now if it feels great to you thats awesome, but I can pretty much tell when youre putting on a show and it just feels strange abd awkward to think youre there with me acting, basically lying to me about what youre going through. Its so hard to lie to somebody during such a personal connection. And if you‚Äôre not willing to connect on that level that you‚Äôd be honest and open to me, i dunno, maybe don‚Äôt have sex with me? Now if we have a honest connection, we might be getting into some really amazing territory and you might be willing to let me know what you want and what hurts and what feels great and a lot of the walls of having to know exactly what the other person wants straight off the bat will come down.   Its strange how ‚Äùsexy‚Äù is often somebody mysterious with possibly a dissociated thousand yard stare. Somebody who is non communicative at least at first glance. Lets make ‚Äùsexy‚Äù about communication and throw out the taboo where somebody needs to know exactly what you like without a word being spoken. Now that doesnt mean it won‚Äôt happen. Communication happens on so many levels all at once. But lets start with communicating more and work our way to nonlingual

Hello There
I grew up in a low socioeconomic area and was one of the few white people in the area. I was targeted and our house was broken into quite a few times. That‚Äôs what started it. Then as I grew and got further education I realised that it‚Äôs low socioeconomic status that causes crime in anyone, any colour, unfortunate enough to be in this circumstance. And that the economic inequality was driven by white people.

I just finally wanted to get the things I need, and finally...FINALLY be happy. And after that? Help my equally stressed out friend repair both cars he can't even use, and his dads car, and pay their rent and bills too.

Doesn't have to be personal. Sometimes I'll have spontaneously a huge fit of anxiety and will cancel super last second and feel too bad about it to reach out again. Also there can be an uncomfortable perception of debt, like because I cancelled last time I owe him now. That makes for a really awkward date so I learned not to try again if I had to cancel like that.   Doesn't happen every time and personally I do cancel and try to explain, but I know for some people the anxiety about the other person's reaction is so bad they rather block and delete everything and try to forget about it. Sucks, but I wouldn't take it personal if this happens to you. It says a lot more about the person doing this than it does about you usually.

It depends on the circumstances. But I require anyone living with me to work 8 hours 5 days a week, unless they have a diagnosed disability. Even then, they have to do what they can do. Some of that time is devoted to the house and/or yard, some of it to dedicated job searches, and some can be time spent volunteering with charities. They also have to do their share of cooking, dishes, etc., on top of that, just like those of us who work at a paying job does.  I've had extended family live with me. Sometimes they have stayed for extended periods. Sometimes, they have decided to leave after a few months.
I liked the multiplayer more than counter strike even. The gameplay wasn‚Äôt as robust, but as a casual gamer it was a lot more fun.

It‚Äôs definitely a life-simulator game.

When I was younger, there was a beaver living on the golf course near my house.   Nobody EVER believed me but I saw it, more than once, on the side of the road. The shape was always way too wrong to be any of the normal local wildlife, and we ARE technically in a river valley, but I was baffled as to what it was until one day I actually saw it whapping the ground with its tail. STILL, NO ONE BELIEVED ME. My mother driving past apparently just never saw it even with me pointing it out.   I suspect the golf course eventually drove it out , because a beaver tryna fuck around in your water hazard is not the kind of feature you want.

I have other family out west that's been through tornados.  They send pictures of them and act like it's no big deal at all.    But we nearly lost our home in 94 and 04 due to flooding.  Extreme weather that rarely happens here.  We live in an area that never floods but both years we had 8 feet of water in our basement. My parents lost vehicles and we lost tons of possessions.  It was a mess but we cleaned up and went on with our lives.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad for everyone. It does have some cool features, but I can't get past the quality.   It reminds me of the mp3s we used to steal from Napster in the 90s. Qobuz, Tidal, Deezer, and Apple all have much better sound.

I'd recommend checking out Larry Lawton's channel on YouTube. Used to be a major jewel thief in the 80s/90s in the US and eventually got caught and convicted.   His videos are pretty entertaining as he talks about his thought process for robberies and time in jail - there's a great one of him critiquing robberies in GTA. Seems like a pretty chill guy now but more than that, he runs educational programs and support networks for ex-cons trying to turn their lives around.

Driving through Texas in the middle of the night, the road 'shifts' to the left. I figure I'm falling asleep so I take a deep breath and drink some water. Then it happens again. Figure I'd better pull over and walk around and wake myself up. I pull over everything shifts again. I step out and... crunch.   It was millions of wingless locusts. All would shift a couple inches to the left every 10 to 15 seconds. Felt like the end of the world.

I got about 200k hands tracked on Pokerstars (only have the 100k icon in the app as well). I've gotten 3 royal flushes in hold'em and 2 on Five Card Draw. So, 5 Royal Flushes in only 200k hands.  I've also seen a royal flush irl playing with friends, drinking and smoking. The person that got it probably has about 300 hands in total played, lol. I don't think she even realized how crazy that was despite us trying to tell her and her boyfriend taking pics, haha. She said: "I'm just happy to win a hand, I did not expect this kind of response. I know it's a good hand but you guys are having more fun with this than I am, which is perfect cus then I can get a beer without holding up the game or anything"   Definitely possible to happen and get lucky. /u/portmanteaunioconte should be happy about this, it just seems impossible to others due to how unlikely it is and people tend to look for answers :p

This one time a guy tried to commit suicide by jumping off a building. While he was up there about 150 members of the neighborhood got together and got him off the roof and to safety. At one point of the rescue the neighborhood started making signs and writing the names of appliances like toaster or lamp on them, and the guy would climb back into his room go find the appliance then climb back out onto the ledge and then wave it around while the whole crowd cheered and applauded like he was doing a show. I have no idea why it took the fire dept to take hours to arrive, I didnt stick around for the entire thing but the guy survived and made the local news. I'll probably never see anything like that again.

I'm in my 50s. I've been married half my life. I am uninterested in being cool, and I'm unconcerned if anyone thinks I'm an asshole. I'm not responsible for the feelings of someone who shows romantic interest in me. No one is. And I've learned that men will take that compassion as romantic interest, and everyone else will say, "why did you lead him on, and what did you expect?"
I'm saying that there's been more than a year of research. Not saying it's fully tested. The scientific consensus is that it's safe enough for wide use and effective at reducing death rates,  mutation rates and transmission. Even with the stuff like the risk of blood clots it's more likely if you get Covid.
My best friend for years was really into sports so I just played sports because he liked them, but all my spare time I would spend playing games or watching anime although my friend told me that all the kids that were into the stuff I actually liked were morons, so I believed him but one day I hung out with them and learnt that surrounding yourself with people that you actually like isn‚Äôt that bad. Now days this kid has gotten into some sketchy stuff and is in a messed up group although as my name suggests I am a massive nerd and personally I prefer that.

Why care what they think, you do you. There‚Äôs also tons of people on the internet who‚Äôd look down on me for having flings when I was younger. Some guys think that makes a woman not marriage material and all that bs. You're never going to get everyone's approval.
That I can work effectively remotely from anywhere.  Before the pandemic I was bought into the idea that you had to be at HQ to have a career.  I was super wrong about that.  I used to travel 100k miles per year and realized I did a lot of managing from the laptop sitting on my knees in an airport (although I really miss travel). I moved my wife 2000 miles away from family for the job of my dreams, now we can spend the time she needs with family, especially grandchildren.   This has been a life changing event for me.

Recently found it on an abadonware site but - Afterdark games - from like early 2000s or late 90s. The most memorable games from the collection are the flying toaster, the pacmanesque ripoff of the lawnmower game, and the apartment destroying game.

Cat's Cradle &amp; Mother Might by Kurt Vonnegut.  Cat's Cradle pokes fun at religion, politics, and identity/social constructs in general in the context of the (in this case, literally) cold war. Mother Night is a spy drama revolving around the idea of "You are what you pretend to be, so be careful what you pretend to be". They're both hilarious books.  Reading both back-to-back deconstructed the feeling that my life was supposed to go some sort of way, the little lies I kept telling myself that kept me from not *the* person, but *somebody* I was happy being, and that I had to actively choose who I wanted to be. It also made me more understanding of why people believe what they believe, and, in result, the cruel irony of tribalism. Additionally, it also showed how suffering might often be malicious, but sometimes it can come from human apathy or things literally just turning out that way. "See the cat? See the cradle?"  I feel like all of the things I just said are obvious aphorisms you see online and go "yeah mhm I agree", but seeing it actually play out in a book really puts it in perspective.  I'll admit - you probably have to be the right age for these books to hit (tail end of high school for me), but *my god* did they hit.  My favorite part is the giant penis grave.

KKC just has so much depth so each time you read it you discover more and more connections. I haven't really gotten that from any other fantasy books even if I've thoroughly enjoyed the reads.

I'm very grateful to be alive right now and in my unaffected apartment. My heart goes out to those who aren't as fortunate as I am.

As a guy?   My face is a 6 on the worst days and borderline 8 on the best days.   I'm quite fit with a dad bod and a developed upper body. Being a former football/soccer player has it's benefits on fitness. I love working out.  I'm a wide reader and so I can entertain a variety of conversations.   I have a creative sense of humor; I don't need to make a joke to be funny. I just make fun of what goes on in everday life.   I love animals; I am in fact a cat dad. I also have a green thumb.  I love an adventure. We can travel the world together.   I drive FAST, but drive well. I can give a good adrenaline rush when it's wanted.   I'm an food enterprise entrepreneur, medic/water rescuer/fireman in training, and educator/academe in hiatus.   I socialize with the elites of my society; my connections are in the right places.   I believe in wisdom, principle, grace, strength, and prudence. I believe that a man should stand for what he believes in, but he must also be open to the possibility that he may be wrong in some of his beliefs and therefore he must change. Change doesn't scare me as I seek to grow and develop all the time. I also believe in giving grace to people, as grace has the power to give people a chance to grow, develop, and shine. Strength is important to man, for how can a man stand for his life and beliefs if he is weak of mind, body, heart, and spirit? I believe in the value of prudence; committing myself to wise decisions and balanced priorities makes the best and the most out of life.   I have an explosive temper and strength that I mastered and controlled; you can expect me to be a sentient beast of a man whenever I have to be. You can also expect me to keep my cool when I choose to. üòéüòà   And in the bedroom? I take things slowly and passionately; I keep things hot and simmering: I don't rush for orgasms; I pace the heat and the sensation to an intensifying crawl toward climax, bringing me and my partner to the edge of an intense orgasm, and I keep it there for as long as possible until the orgasm irresistably erupts. üòé

Well I used to be a libertarian so there is a part of me that views this as something of a shame, but note the 'used to be' and the a big reason why I am no longer a libertarian is it's hard to keep going when you realise you are fighting for people's freedoms that they don't want, and certainly don't want to give back to you.  So this specific issue doesn't personally affect me so I don't really care anymore.  Anyone of that age bracket who wants to smoke probably will still be able to anyway what with black markets, govt failure and such (the libertarian snark still resides within me).

I mean, Ariana Grande was *not* shy about saying that he was good in bed even after they broke up. Of course, she also claimed that he had a ten inch penis, so either Pete is seriously hung like a fucking mule or she thinks he's such a phenomenal guy that she wing-manned him to the entire world by claiming he has a double digit dick and knows exactly how to use it. Either way it's a serious plus for the dude.

It's a trap  turn back. Do not go any futher
with two six sided dice there are some easier combos than others - 7 is the most common TOTAL result. "Snake eyes" (two ones) requires both dice to roll the same thing.   The odds of any *chain of events* happening in a specific way are always tiny. The odds of *the next roll of the dice* are only EVER exactly the odds of the dice. Period. If you roll two six sided dice, you stand a one in thirty-six chance of getting snake eyes. Every. Time. You. Roll.

If you are afraid and you don't feel comfortable being honest then DONT EXPECT men to not be confused. You meant to be confusing! Be understanding that the signals are mixed and meant to confuse and diffuse any anger they may have and don't put it on them to "be more mature." Just be understanding that what you did worked as intended to diffuse any possible altercation, and it worked. However, in using that tactic you left it ambiguous purposely and it isn't on a man to read that far into your emotions. Congratulations you succeed in what you were intending to do by obfuscating your intentions. That isn't in any way making them any less mature by being confused by your purposefully mixed signals. That's literally saying "grow up and learn when someone is lying to you, and take the hint!" That's blaming the victim in the situation, so you can scapegoat the liar. I get why you would lie, I do. But then if you know you have to, then don't expect men to "be the bigger person"  Tldr; if you mean to obfuscate your intentions, don't belittle men for being caught in your obfuscations.

I need ideas asap
I'm way late but I finally have an answer for one of these.   GOTCHA FORCE! seems to be a game only me and a handleful of my friends ever played.   It was a Capcom release for the Nintendo GameCube in which you play a 10 year old kid when an alien race of action figures lands on your planet.  You team up with the Optimus prime looking figure, and other friends get their own side kicks, and you go through a campaign of repetitive 3rd person battles in these interesting zones like "bedroom" "playground" and "school."   As the campaign progressed you'd get more "points" to build a bigger team and collect some of the action figures you fought which all has vaatly different play styles.  Like "ninja" who was squishy, threw shurikens and bombs and had close range attack, or "machine Gunner" who had a Gatling gun with 100 rounds that took forever to reload, or "fire dragon" which was a giant slow moving tank that could fly and shoot fireballs.   The real game was local vs player, since you and your friends could build vastly different parties and fight them together.  It's the game Pokemon should have always been, but forced you to play a boring and repetitive campaign to collect better guys.

This was in the 90's. It was a PC game where you're a tank and other AI tanks are out to 'hunt' you, basically if they ram into you, you die and the game restarts.  I don't remember the objective of the game. It's either you need to drive around to pick up all the objective markers and head back to your 'base', or run down the clock, or both.  There might be powerups to lay traps for the AI tanks, I can't remember.  Style-wise, it was kinda dark and it was in 3D.

As someone who like having their own time and who love soending time with my friends. The only time we can talk is lunch time since the teacher were pretty strict and my family i told him i want to keep our relationship secret but right after i accepted him his whole friend groups knew well telling friends wasnt a problem because if he trust them why not? I also told my bestfriend so i understand him but the next day my whole junior class knew about our relationship and our whole class knew about our relationship but i didnt get mad at him and let it slip but told him to blocked my sister and not make a post on Instagram. He blocked my sister and yea didnt post it but he put ours photo (backside) in his profile pic but it was just our back so i let it slip once again. As i stated i love having time on my own (and i am shy) when i need time alone its means i was losing my temper or something my friends understand that so when i said 'leave me alone' or 'i want to be alone' they fully understand and leave me alone but he always sulk or get angry at me and even called our relationship 'onesided' saying he is the only one loving me. And i told him that i was shy and needed time and he snap at me saying he is also shy but still talk to me. I admit i dont really talk to him irl but we talk alot on social media. I do talk to him in real life too but i was scared my sister or someone who know my sister will caught us and after months exam come, i had period and i noticed it after i submitted my paper (it was the start of pandemic) so i told one of my friends about my period and all so i didnt have time to talk to him cause right after we got over my oeriod incident they came to pick me up so i went home after that lockdown and all and yea he still say i didnt talk to him much so i couldnt deal with him and told him i wasnt 'into' our relationship and say that we should break up and yea we break up and now i still feel sorry for not talking to him properly but i understand him getting mad but i still think 'relationship' wasnt mean for us.

I played a multiplayer game based on Dragonlance universe for a few years, never got to read the books because I was under the impression they were of mediocre quality. Like, if Tolkien and maybe Pratchett were the 1st rank, Rowling, Glen Cook, Bujold were 2nd, and *Mother of Learning* 3rd, then Dragonlance is no higher than 4th. (And I honestly like *Mother of Learning*, it just doesn't seem like a very high-quality literature.) Am I wrong?

It is physically hard to read at first as it is literally written in a Scottish accent. Spud‚Äôs parts are particularly difficult to get used to. Good book, well written (again once you get used to the writing style). Also recommend Filth and Marabou Stork Nightmares. Welsh plays with the way the page is set out in both. Which sounds extraordinary pretentious but in one he uses it to switch between the man and his tapeworm and the other different levels of consciousness of a coma patient. Really interesting use of a page.

in NZ we have public healthcare. the taxpayer pays extra money to the government to make it run. a smoker has health problems. this adds strain to the health system. and by extension, by having taxpayer money spent on medical attention to someone dying from a preventable tobacco related disease, also to the taxpayer. cigarettes are highly taxed yes, but its not enough, it doesn't cover damages, and also, because its not about money. not all damage is financial. its about people. tobacco kills people. so we, as logical, well thinking people, are trying to eradicate tobacco use.

They're gonna come at your house, make sure everything is alright, buy you some healthy food and groceries that you might need, they're gonna help you clean the house and do some chores, john the tech guy is gonna look for a job posting that suits you and is very employee friendly, they're gonna cook for all of you for a week or two, maybe more if you need that help, make sure that you slowly but surely gain more reaponsibility.   Some nights you'll do the cooking, sure you know a few dishes but they help anyway, the next day your cleaning the house, the next doing dishes. Slowly and slowly they will help you rebuild your confidence. To become the best you can be or at least on the way to becoming.    And then one day, when you wake up, when all is set and you are fine, they will  be gone. Traces you shall not find.     And you MIGHT cry. But it's not the same tears that you used to shed like yesterday.    And then you'll make breakfast.
I was driving home from a farm late at night approx 10pm. The farm was located miles from civilisation, rural area, on lots of winding roads and steep hills. No streetlighting or nearby houses. A storm was coming, so there was strong cloud cover blocking out all night-time stars. Also, many branches from tall trees grew overhead. Anyway, all these elements created an environment that was absolutely pitch black - I mean JET BLACK. The only thing creating any light was my headlights, and it was the creepiest feeling to look in my rear vision mirrors and see nothing but absolute darkness surrounding me (especially when I knew there was bushland there). Was maybe a 45 minute drive before coming to the nearby country town. I've never experienced such darkness whilst driving before, it was genuinely terrifying, and felt like the end of the world!

i got several: the world does not revolve anyone, and everything you achieved in high school will stay in high school.  part of life is to get hurt some times, whether physical or mental, and it can be avoided, but you sometimes have to get hurt in order learn how to avoid it.  things dont always go your way, and getting angry or upset will never help.   respect is something you earn from others, and only by showing it to the people you want respect from.   one final piece of advice/knowledge: r*** and abuse are r*** and abuse, regardless of what type of person the victim is (in terms of gender, religion, etc)

This has the potential to be a minefield, so I'm going to put the UK govt definitions here. They are used by the Office of National Statistics.   There are other definitions and this doesn't touch other genders, but it's a good baseline and officially recognised.  &#x200B;  >The UK government defines sex as:       referring to the biological aspects of an individual as determined by their anatomy, which is produced by their chromosomes, hormones and their interactions       \- generally male or female       \- something that is assigned at birth       The UK government defines gender as:       \- a social construction relating to behaviours and attributes based on labels of masculinity and femininity; gender identity is a personal, internal perception of oneself and so the gender category someone identifies with may not match the sex they were assigned at birth       \- where an individual may see themselves as a man, a woman, as having no gender, or as having a non-binary gender ‚Äì where people identify as somewhere on a spectrum between man and woman.

It varies from person to person. I care more as I get older, and I do get anxious in particularly bad storms, but it's still not really guiding my decision making.

As a former smoker who has had friends and family die from it, I am all for this.  Normally I am not one to try and take away someone's choices, but smoking literally has no pros and many many cons.  When ever someone tells me that smoking helps with their stress I just reply that the 15 minutes they take to go outside and have a smoke would have the same effect without them actually smoking.

You're absolutely right, and over the past couple of year I've basically figured all of that out on my own and I understand for the most part how I'm perceived and how my lack of social skills is the cause of it. But for some reason the thoughts stick with me. I can calm myself down when nobody is around and fully convince myself to relax and try to talk to people, but as soon as I walk by someone it's like I hit a switch and my brain becomes paralyzed.

Yeah I've seen something similar near Ningaloo in Western Australia. Calm waters in a lagoon, but a school of little fish started going crazy near the shore.

You see some amazing marine life in that part.

For the duration that we don't have decent alternatives, some things that are bad for the environment are something of a necessity to function in modern society.  We don't exactly have a robust public transportation system in many countries, so yes, we need cars in those countries. There's an excellent and ***long*** discussion to be had about the meat industry, but it's not comparable to smoking since it still engages a need humans have (whether or not that need can be met through other methods). Smoking isn't a need and it doesn't engage any tertiary needs. It is ***wholly*** a bad thing with any "benefit" being so modest that it obviously is incomparable to the damage it causes, given that there are no needs it meets.

Not really. The market for stolen art is limited at best and most major players are already known to authorities. It's not like stealing a car that could be easily spotted in public, so getting the word out won't really help. If the thieves think they got away with the art then there's a better chance of them getting caught selling it. Also insurance companies are massively confidential and aren't required to release records publicly. Police generally don't care about stolen art outside specialist units of state or national law enforcement. If they're even informed in the first place.

While waiting for the 4th of July fireworks show in Orlando, Florida, 2007, we saw a double rainbow get ‚Äúhit‚Äù by a giant bolt of forked lightning.  I know rainbows aren‚Äôt discrete objects so it wasn‚Äôt really being hit. But the lightning was terrifying and spectacular. It looked like the sky was being splintered like a pane of glass, as if the lightning was just revealing crack lines. The rainbow was in the middle/ on the other side? It really messed with depth perception. Felt like something out of a Lovecraft novel.

I want to do it so bad. I'm not lazy at all. I berate myself constantly for being unable to just do whatever needs to be done.

Yeah it still sound like you were thinking about yourself too much in those interactions. Like how insulted I'd feel if I thought someone wanted to know something about me but then listen to themselves talking about how stupid their own question was while I was answering it? I think my advice doesn't apply to you because you don't understand what I mean by look outside yourself. People don't get that and think they're not being narcissistic thinking about themselves if the thoughts are all negative. It's like, no, you're still thinking about yourself too much here, step outside yourself. Listen üëÇ

It's not something I would ever do but if people want to do it that's on them.  It is not my place to judge their choice of what they eat, and I think it's not unreasonable to expect the same in return.  The only thing I ask is that if they're a pet owner I hope they understand that while humans can be herbivores, dogs are not, and cats especially are obligate carnivores, so if you chose this lifestyle for yourself and your human family that's fine, but do not put that lifestyle on your pets.  That could seriously harm them.

I think with all religions, they don't change people. If you're a hateful person, you're a hateful Christian/Muslim/voodoo practitioner/etc. If you're a kind person, you're a kind  Christian/Muslim/voodoo practitioner/etc. You look in your holy book and find yourself.  The only time a Muslim caused me inconvenience was when I lived in a house with 4 other dudes in college and one of them was Muslim and he had his own separate fridge for his food.

Then that‚Äôs something that you let the person know? I feel like my comment is being vastly misinterpreted.

Rhythm is learned. You can do it with enough practice and if you‚Äôre trying to stay busy then the need to practice is exactly what you need. As far as building and crafting goes that‚Äôs up to you and will depend on what you‚Äôre into. I personally love music so I build instruments out of household items. I also love to fly fish so I tie my own flies which is definitely a form of crafting. I have a buddy who loves wood working so he builds furniture and sells it. My wife is into making jewelry so she does that in her free time. You just have to find something you‚Äôre into.

See, this is why people judge you. Not because you're white, but because you're equivicating this kind of slavery (which was no doubt bad) with generations of chattel slavery, where Black people were born into chains and could not ever remove them unless they escaped (which if captured was penalty of death.)  Being a slave for a time is not the same thing as centuries of you are a slave, your mom and dad were slaves (unless your dad was a slave-owner who raped your mom), and your children will be slaves.

Programmer QA. Coders do the hard part. You just clean up their code.
Eh, I knew a lot of shit kids who didn't want to try or do the work regardless, many of them with Karen parents. I want reform sure, and I am trusting the teacher's judgment here in saving those kids by doing that, but I distrust how much are people who want to learn in a productive, effective fashion, and those being lazy and not wanting to learn things in the first place. Not everyone cares about paying attention in history and political science classes, yet here we are in the world. Definitely the dearth of people's ability to retain knowledge, especially as it relates to history, not to mention critical thinking skills, shows.
You're going off the deep end here.     I'm just looking for a single source that has a running number of covid autopsies reported. Like the "Covid counters" you see all across the net, but an "Autopsy counter".      No, google doesn't produce that for m,e, but maybe you're right and  I'm just inept     You make it sound as if you were able to quickly find the answer to my question when *you* googled though, care to share the source?
Hurt - Johnny Cash (Cover)  Nothing but pain in that song
No you are good.  I guess my comment didn't make it.  But it was basically said.  I see you,  I understand that feeling as well.  You are loved and strong and so worthwhile to this world.
I think you should tell him you know but assure him you have his back. As his spouse he should trust you to keep his secret, and will probably feel a great deal of relief since you are probably the one person he feels guilty lying to. Tell him you still think he‚Äôs the smartest guy you‚Äôve ever known, but he doesn‚Äôt have to hide anything from you.

Well I'll tell you 2 one from when I was little and one from now when I'm older.  Well I start, when I was little my parents did  abandon me with the computer and I spent hours watching YouTube and then one day haha damn it makes me laugh just remembering it, do you remember the smile HD video? Well, just seeing the beginning scared me shit  And now when I grow up, I suppose that not many things scare me, but it still scares me.

Yup.  This is a big thing with people who force little kids to hug and kiss people/relatives.  If they say no, don't make them.  Body autonomy applies to small children just like it applies to adults.

> If you and your partner can afford it  The thing is, the tradition scales with income, so it by definition is a thing you can't afford. The idea behind an expensive engagement ring is 2 or 3 months salary to show how much the man is willing to sacrifice for the woman. It's rooted in very toxic relationship dynamics.  By all means get an engagement ring that you both think looks great, but it will remain shitty to base the quality of the relationship on how much money the man is willing to waste on an overpriced rock.

True, but do all that to a real person and I doubt they'd be driving well so soon after the second knockout. Movie characters can recover from being knocked out by just "shaking it off" and a quick scene change.   Biff was knocked out for over a minute. According to [Brainfacts.org](https://www.brainfacts.org/diseases-and-disorders/injury/2018/what-happens-when-youre-knocked-unconscious-112018):  >If someone is knocked unconscious for more than a minute and symptoms don‚Äôt fade within a few minutes, it is important to bring them to an emergency room to get checked for a more severe traumatic brain injury. Doctors will check to make sure there is no internal bleeding or bruising that can be dangerous.  Biff was out for about a minute at least. A real person in his situation would be going to the ER, not going to his car for a high speed fight over a magazine. Then again, this also was set in the 1950's so maybe they were more lax about brain damage then.
When I was 14 years old, I and a friend stopped a taxi and ran away, we never thought that the guy would chase us ... we walked 3 blocks and he appeared in front of us, I tried to run but my legs got blocked, the man ended up kicking me in the ground .. I have never fucking told it!

I will remember this and come back here to reply when the 2022 midterms happen and it results in the single biggest defeat for the democrats in decades. You are absolutely wrong that Republicans are outnumbered.  To be clear, I'm not saying "haha in your face" I'm saying "You do not know what you are talking about." Republicans stand to take a massive majority in the midterms and this is coming from predictions on both sides.

Formula 1 has plenty of dick moves which are so common people have become blind to how dickish they are.  I think the biggest one is playing favorites with the drivers (aka "team orders"). Every team fields 2 cars. In a lot of teams, there is a clear number 1 and number 2 driver. Number 1 gets everything handed to them. Number 2 gets the scraps.  Example from the very last race. Red Bull Number 2 driver Checo Perez was running comfortably in 3rd place. That would've given him a place on the podium, big bottle of champagne, a trophy, and a nice little addition to his lifetime statistics. He drove an absolutely amazing race. [He managed to go toe-to-toe with 7 time world champion Lewis Hamilton on very worn out tires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7cAfXFnAwA). He deserved to be on the podium.  But... they forced him to retire his car because they were worried it might fail on the road which would trigger a safety car. Under a safety car, drivers have to reduce speed to match the pace of the safety car (around 100 mph slower). At the time, they thought this could have a huge detriment to Red Bull's Number 1 driver. They made him quit the race.
great because I didn‚Äôt need to worry about what to wear. but they were ugly as hell and I was forced to wear a skirt. would be great if I were given the choice to wear pants instead.

I'm not saying all that. I'm just saying Afghanistan is very tribal and even if the taliban isn't in control the lifestyle isn't that different. Rural government forces We're weak and corrupt. If the US wasn't looking they'd do whatever they wanted including trafficking little boys and forcing them to give up school. That local government and tribes need a complete purging if anything would have gotten done. That would require greater US control tho and our government was slowly leaving

Most people become millionaires by starting a business.  You need to find a product or service that will satisfy a need in the market. Make estimations on the sales and costs. If you estimate that you can make a profit in the long run, prepare a business plan. If you can't afford initial costs, take a loan or find partners, investors. Hire people and manage the organization. At first, you will probably need to work 15-18 hours a day because you will be under heavy liability if the business fails. As time goes, you will streamline most of the processes, and you will be able to delegate most of your work to other people.

Minecraft I miss the childhood curiosity from that game.
I told time and time again that father M ( Catholic priest) was doing stuff to me when I was a child, it sometimes took place in front of my parents ( 10yo me, sitting awkwardly on his knees, his hand under my skirt) . They were blind.  Later when I confronted them, my parents always acted like it was the first time I spoke about it.  Therapy helped me to understand they couldn't hear me.  I'm a little bit messed up, but I swore to myself that I wasn't going to reproduce this behavior.
I was probably about 12 and I wanted to go to the library.  I rode my bike there, and it was probably about a mile.  As soon as I get back I'm faced with 20 questions, "what did I do," "why did five people call and report what I did?," etc.  I was baffled, I rode my bike to the library and came back home as I always did.  Well I was riding my bike out in the middle of the road and about five of my neighbors called and told on me.  To be fair I lived out in the middle of absolutely no where, there were no cars coming and I was never in any danger, but because it was a small gossipy town where people had to peek out their windows and tell on every little thing EVERYONE saw me ride my bike in the middle of the road (again, where NO cars were coming) but I still was banned and grounded from going to the library on my bike by myself until the end of the summer.  So stupid.  I could understand *if* there were cars and *if* we lived in a big town, but it was a rural town with no traffic, what did I do so wrong?

I love how people take this specific verse out of context as if it means to say Muslims are allowed to kill anyone for simply not being Muslims.   Are you not going to mention that this verse was revealed during the time when a holy war was taking place? That this was taking place against people who were preventing Muslims from practicing their religion?  But no. Ignore the context to suit your narrative.

Went on an actual date with her 4 days later and pretty much moved in part time a week or 2 after that, then she pretty much never went back home after 2 months, and now we are happily married for 3 years been together 7

I used to lie everyday about going to work and college to my parents. Would edit screenshots of grades i previously got to match the current date, make up fake report cards, research stuff i could‚Äôve learned throughout the day in class to talk about it at the dinner table. I used to ‚Äúfake‚Äù going to work. I didn‚Äôt have a car and during the winter i could stay up to 8 hours outside, basically freezing, not to get caught by my family. I made some money from boosting on League of Legends (playing a video game i am very good at), so my parents really never knew how much money i had in the bank, they could only see i could afford stuff so they didn‚Äôt question it. I had so much pressure on my shoulders to be successful from myself and my family, but school was just not it for me, but rather than quitting and telling the truth i preferred lying to my entire family to avoid their disapointment. I was deeply depressed, and as time went on for an entire year it got worse and worse. I eventually got caught by my father who did my taxes for me when he asked for papers of my college to prove i was still a full time student not to pay as many taxes. I could not provide them, and he eventually caught on that i wasn‚Äôt in college anymore. I ended up explaining everything, how i lied basically for an entire year about my entire life. My parents weren‚Äôt very receptive, but they didn‚Äôt kick me out. They brang me to our family doctor so i could get pills for my depression, and supported me by paying for a therapist, that i still see once a month to this day, 7 months later. I honestly thought after they knew it all they would give up on me, i would be living on the street and struggling, but they didn‚Äôt. I am now working a full time job, making fine money, bought a car and looking at appartments i could move into for next year (holy shit prices are high). I‚Äôm thankful about my friends, siblings, parents who never let me down even after all the problems i‚Äôve caused, and very importantly i thank myself, for not giving up and ending it all. Even in dark times, even if you think only the worse can happen, seek help. People will surprise you, and with enough people dragging you up, eventually you‚Äôll see light at the end of the tunnel. Life is worth living, do not give up.

I was at work and came home to an open door and a broken window. Inside, everything was dumped on the floor. I mean plates and cups and clothing: all of it. They spray painted a wall in the hallway and stole just about everything of (financial) value to me. The worst part was that my cats both have entirely different personalities now. The male turned super aggressive and the female gets anxiety.   Absolute best part was the sheriff‚Äôs department doing absolutely nothing. Sure, they sent out a deputy and she took a report but that was the end of it. I had to contact the ATF (yup, most of my guns were taken), the bank, everything. I never got so much as a callback from the SO. But I had insurance so I got a big check a couple of months later. I used that money to move away and start over.

Pretty much from the minute I met him which is corny as hell haha.

Would you consider Playboy porn? They use the poses of the PreRaphealite paintings and so forth. Playboy also has more Pulitzer prize winning writers and articles than any other publication. But is it PORN? Do YOU consider it PORN? Is the statue of Micheal PORN, it was carved VERY in depth.  Porn is subjective to the audience. Now I DO NOT agree with exposing children to sexualized media or content. But what is porn to one person, is NOT to another. And Europeans are MUCH less sexually repressed than Americans.
Haha, I like it!  the original is e (Euler's constant, approximately 2.718) raised to the exponent of the quantity pi times the square root of 163. That amount is very close to 640320 cubed + 744.   There is a pattern with several other numbers. 163 is significant because it is 41*4-1.   It also works with 17. You do 17*4-1 and get 67. You then can see that e raised to the exponent of the quantity pi times the square root of 67 is very close to 5280 cubed + 744.  So, 744 is an unexpectedly interesting number.   The pattern holds for 5 times 4-1 = 19 and 11 times 4-1 = 43. But 41 is thought to be the highest number this operation works for, though that has not been definitely proven.   For reasons I don't fully understand, numbers that fit this pattern have another property. If you start with 41 and add 2, you get 43, a prime number. Then if you add 4, you get 47, another prime. You keep going by adding 6, 8, 10, and so forth until you get to 1681, which is 41^2. These are called the Euler primes (e.g. 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 83, 97, ‚Ä¶).   You can see the pattern play out more quickly starting with 5. You get 5, 7, 11, 17, 25.

No, it doesn't.   People have a certain rule of conduct, depending on place and time.   Our society and it's people have accepted that wearing revealing clothing in certain places publicly is normal and non-sexual, unless they consent to such thing, and most people of all sexes and sexualities treat it that way, bar few who still make sorry excuses for being badly behaved.  It is not wearers fault, that looker lacks the social and emotional intelligence/education that most are raised with and power of will beyond that of a wild animal to control their actions.  All the wearer is doing is following said rules and behavior, and they expect others to do the same.  *of course, I fully believe the same should go in places where this is not acceptible, whether I personally disagree with it or not)*  And I do stress the point of education, because this is all very easily correctable.  (One of the reasons) why we don't have the same discussions about what men should wear, is because vast majority of women (of any sexuality, really) dont do that.  They ain't no significantly less horny or visual then men, but are raised NOT to behave that way, since early age by everyone around them.  Or are emotionally intelligent enough to know how to properly hide when they have hots for someone, in public spaces, to not be creepy.  Men (of any sexuality) not as attentively raised and get often pass for such behavior in early age (boys will be boys and all that sleazy jazz) from either parents or peers (no, media and HR teams talking about "r*pe culture" doesn't make for a effective  education that teaches how to behave)  And even so, I think most socialized men know how to act in most public spaces, especially beaches, when revealing clothing is present.  So, frankly, there is no excuse.

The 2nd high school I went to had a winter uniform and a summer uniform (they got rid of it the year I started which was annoying as the summer uniform looked good). I personally thought they were fine, it put everyone on an even standing so you couldn't tell if someone was poor or whatever, so it did reduce cases of bullying.   Plus, it gets you ready for the working world where you'll be expected to wear a uniform or dress a certain way etc.

I was visiting Dubrovnik. My first morning there I woke up before the sun and set out with my camera to explore. I absolutely love watching a new city wake up and exploring it for the first time. I watched the sun rise over the Adriatic. I wandered the old town and saw the beautiful pink and purple light begin to light the buildings. I smelled the bread baking in the bakeries and saw shopkeepers putting tables out for breakfast. I felt like I had the whole city to myself. It was pure bliss.

My mom was of the belief that everyone else was wrong, always. So there was no need for her to ever change. Or to ever apologize. Ever. Everyone else was always the problem and if someone didn't like her, they were a bitch.   I was like her for a long while. Then I was in a terrible marriage, and as that began to unravel I just had a few realizations about myself and started working on that. I'm still more negative than I would like to be at times, and have a tendency to go for snark in situations it's not called for. But I've been working on it for a long time now (about 10 years), and I'm a lot better than I used to be, and it doesn't negatively impact my life like it used to.   I think my biggest issue now is seeing people's posts on fb about missing their parents at the holidays. I feel bad because I'm relieved to not have to deal with that drama this year. Like....missing someone sucks, but I wish I'd had a good enough relationship with her to have something to miss. It makes me angry.

Hey there OP, when replying to a specific comment, use the reply button beneath that comment. If you make a new top level comment as you have been doing, no one can tell  what you mean.
> They're being themselves  That's not how religion works. It's a system of beliefs. You need to be taught these beliefs, otherwise you don't know them. So almost by definition they're embracing someone else's beliefs, which means that strictly speaking they're not being themselves. They could choose that route for mental comfort, obviously, which would be an expression of their true selves.

Bro, i also didn't solve it medically.   But when you seat on the bed, looking at your dick bleeding out, believe me it's the fucking worst.   Now it's ok, i don't how, maybe it stretched with the injury, never ended up going to the doctor, it didn't break completely, it was a small thing but in that moment if you made me choose to loose an arm to stop i would.   I was lucky it stopped. And I was very careful after, but if it really breaks completely you can get serious problems.   Really. Go make arrangements for that.

I am always mystified by such tabu in the modern times where same sex marriage is permitted and increasingly seen as normal while close relatives sex or marriage is frown upon. I can see that it is not common and there maybe some health issues for pregnancy but illegality should not be the case in view of other practices that are permitted.

Yes, thats right. The regime under Hitler was the first to industrialize genocide, if you can say it like this. But it's true. What I also think is that Stalin wasn't that great as a leader but he was necessary. I think that if Stalin wouldn't got to this historical position as the ruler of the ussr, Hitler may have been victorious on Operation Barbarossa. The cold winters were hard, but the rapid industrailization of the ussr caused by Stalin was necessary to get the nazis to a hold.  So yeah, the nazis have industrialized genocide, but I think that without the second world war and the crimes against humanity that have been done in that time, we wouldn't have the pretty good times today. I think it would've been far worse in terms of equality and so on.  World History of the 20th century is heavily based around the first world war and the results from that. And we can feel the results from it even now in some abstract way. The second world war is the direct result of the first one. Rising of fascism in Germany was a direct result from that as well.   What I wanted to portray with my comment was only the thing that most other bad guys are completely forgotten about in history. At least not portrayed in a light that they deserved as well.

Blade Runner and Gravity.  Both suck ass always have always will
when I was evicted, my bf asked his parent to take me home. I had an older brother, and older sister, their mom who "loves me as a daughter", and no one of them wanted to give me a bed, while THEY made it happen (very long story).  First thing my brother told me was to ask my bf if he could get me. I felt so bad about it...  He was nervous. His parents welcomed me that same day, tried to make me comfortable (my in-laws are the sweetest on earth), but I felt so heartbroken... So depressed... I never wanted to leave my bf's room, unless for work or, maybe, eat. Then we bought a car and found a house. We're 6 years together now, and I will always remember that horrible time where he was there, for me.  I love him so much...

I have a couple, actually.  World of Warcraft, both current retail and vanilla. I'd been playing since 2007 when I was a teen, never missed more than maybe a couple weeks at a time. The current expansion is the first time I've missed a patch coming out. Think I've missed two by now, it's been like 10 months or something. The community is shit (didn't know till I played FF14 honestly, huge difference in chats), the grind is never ending, the end game covenant things don't share across characters so you have to grind hours per day PER CHARACTER or fall behind. The cap for whatever the grind was always got raised, so no real end in sight, which was disheartening. WoW also suffers from the same one-upping issue Pokemon has - every new iteration, they have to make the story bigger and more dramatic, raise the stakes, do something more incredible, and it's ridiculous now. Vanilla had an even worse community who mistook simple quality-of-life changes for making the game "too easy" and allowing less serious players to enjoy it. Because that apparently ruins the fun of being an elitist in World of fukin Warcraft.  I also hate Scrap Mechanic, but I think I'm being unfair on it. When we played as a group, it was painful. It lagged super hard (apparently fixed a week(ish?) after we called it quits), and the combat just wasn't fun like that. You eventually get a gun, but not till basically the end. Speaking of the end, we got to the last building, fought our way all the way to the end, and the very last elevator broke. We got trapped, couldn't get out, nothing responded to actions, so we just collectively decided we'd done enough, the last boss couldn't possibly be worth it. Lag and bugs aside, it was probably a pretty alright game, but the issues of it being early in release were only worsened by the deep depressive state I was in the midst of. I still hold a grudge.  There's a lot of games I barely played and hated every second, like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, but I just despise the genres and was only doing it for a reward, so even if it was a better game, it'd be a grind that would make it a chore instead of something fun I want to do.

There is a species of fly called the botfly that deposits its eggs under your skin and then the larva develop inside of your skin. They grow until they‚Äôre ready to hatch and then they burst out of your skin and crawl out and fly away. It takes about 8 to 9 days for the eggs to mature and it  is normally around 10 to 15 eggs per laying but most of them die in your skin because they get squished. They mostly live in Africa and South America and other places where the dangerous things are. Sweet dreams tonight!üòâ

(i know, i know, but  there are very few woman builders where i live....so....yeah, men usually build buildings including the toilettes) 3. there are health and hygiene inspectors and officials who are men,so...why not make new standards about urinals if the old ones are bad? 4. am i just prejudiced or are american men especially finicky about close contact and nudity? men in my country are often very casual about it.....and they are pretty homophobic at the same time....so its not like that.... so why?

Bc generally older religions tend more toward polytheism,  witch seems to satiate the human need for spirituality. But Polytheism fails to address the fundamental questions of God and its multiple deities dont meet the criteria for creations need of a creator. Monotheistic religions are the only ones that can back their beliefs with sound & solid theology, and stand up to scrutiny. Polytheism fails completely. That's why critics of religion will always draw upon those examples to try and  make all religion seem as  ridiculous or unfounded.
Probably an unpopular one, but I just could not get into the Alex Cross series by James Patterson. I really liked the movies that had Morgan Freeman in them and I‚Äôve enjoyed reading other crime dramas from Tony Hillerman, David Baldacci, and love anything by John Grisham; so I thought I‚Äôd really like the Alex Cross series.   I actually was at a flea market and they had a bundle of 5 or so of the first books for $1 each so I bought the whole bundle.

My dog at the time hated men, (Rescued rott mix used for fighting) he had previously bitten men who've come to close to me. While meeting my dog I warned him and told him to stand still and I'll hold vader (my dog) and go from there. He came in and I was holding vader back. Vader didn't bark or do much of anything, then he broke free from my grip and launched himself at him. I though oh God he's gonna die, this is it, my dog will be put down and I'll be a murderer. But vader started licking him! I was in shock and he was too! Later he saw how vader reacted to other men while in town and vader being in the car. I knew that if the dog who would protect me with his life fully trusted him then I will too.

Been there, done that.  I told her that I smell the possibility of her having taken up a buf or something and that this seems highly likely based on my previous experiences and I would suggest consulting the gyn.  I mean, people can get these whatevers from public toilets even, so no reason for shame, but a reason to visit a doc.

A piece of advice my friend. Unless the breakup was mutual, take care of the parent who didn't want the divorce. My mom past away 3 months after the separation. It was diagnosed as stage 4 lung cancer, but he symptoms literally showed up days after my dad decided to leave. I know this doesn't help you feel better directly, but I tried focusing on myself during their separation and now I spend every Christmas thinking if I am a bad son for trying to celebrate Christmas on my mother's death anniversary.

Digital services are untrustworthy. Google Play shutdown has shown that nothing last forever. I've also seen digital music mysteriously disappear from other streaming services and catalogues.

She never lets me forget that I was her childhood crush, so maybe dark magic?  But no seriously, we drifted apart when I was 12 and she 11 (I changed churches), fast forward 8 years later I'm at a party and a friend of mine posts a story with me, and friend of her (my now SO) responds with "Is that Akoya_Seishu?".  My friend at the party says "Yeah", they chat, then tells me "Hey, I have this friend I just chatted, she says you were childhood friends and she even had the biggest crush on you, and I went "I have no idea who she is" (I have horrible memory). Fast forward a month, I'm mindlessly scrolling Instagram, remember this story, and send a friend request to this girl. We chat, a lot, I mean from that moment forward she was the person I most talked with daily, we become good friends, by the end of the year I invite her to spend the New Year's Eve with me and my family at a beach house, magic happens, and kaboom.

When you're in the elevator with a group of people and get to the bottom, and it opens, and a handful of people lurch forward to get in. Now we are standing there, face to face in gridlock. During this moment you say to yourself, *how long until they realize they are the ones who have to move or you are not going to get out of the elevator, ever*. Then you see a look of surprise sweep over their face, and then they move back.

Saudi and israel are actually allies.
They're told to, pretty much.  Their Bible says they have to put their god first, that's the first commandment (for Christians, anyway).  Church preaches it and they fear their god so they do.

‚ÄúWhat happened to google‚Äù
My husband met me at a desert party, and when we started working at the same job, we took breaks together and talked about parties and mutual friends, rehab, etc (we both had crazy young adult years).   On New Year‚Äôs Eve I was working and he offered to pick me up from work and drive me home. I was staying at my parents house and don‚Äôt drive so appreciated the offer. When he showed up to drive me home, we drove about two blocks and he looked at me stone cold sober and said ‚ÄúI had champagne at home and shouldn‚Äôt be driving, can we go to my house tonight? It‚Äôs close and roommates are having a party‚Äù  Yes, he was lying and I completely knew he wasn‚Äôt drunk, but happy to hang out and avoid my family. After the weekend, he asked if I liked living on the living room floor at my parents house (obviously not) and if id like to stay at his house (Said he‚Äôd sleep on the couch in his room and I could have his bed)  That was 15 years ago NYE. It works because we‚Äôre both a bit crazy and love each other unconditionally, and we both have evolved into sober (kind of) adults who love our dog and video games.   Having said that, I‚Äôve had girlfriends and they‚Äôre so much work. Every so often you find a girl who is truly down to earth and doesn‚Äôt play games, hold on to them.

If you aren't looking for buddies then you know you can just cut to the sex part with a sex worker, right?

They began talking and my father told Sr. that he had all of this memerobilia of his son that he would like to get signed. So, Sr. took all of it and said that he would get back to him. A while later, we received a package in the mail and to his surprise every item in there was signed by Cal Ripken Jr. This was the first time ever that I saw my father cry.

No no not at all, I don't think any of that nonsense. You are right it's about gangs but I don't think the cause of gangs is poverty entirely. Single parent households (mainly fatherless), the "glam" culture of gang life, poor schooling with little or no choice. Most poor people are not committing crime so cannot be the absolute cause and plenty of people not in poverty commit crimes.

Common interests, doing interesting in your life, grooming, listening more than talking, being true to yourself, understanding relationship dynamics and social cues.   For as much shit as pick up artist self help gets it was where I started out. I learned things that really helped like framing reality in conversations, not being needy, disqualifying yourself as a potential suitor, demonstrating attractive traits, staying out of the friend zone, being playful, starting with brother/sister touching before mutually moving to boyfriend/girlfriend touching.   I have autism and was extremely awkward for all of high school and most of college, but eventually it all came together and with the help of tinder I was doing very well. Not to be too gross, but eventually I kept a changing rotation of girls. It consumed my social life and made me feel sad inside.  I‚Äôve been married for 5 years now. We have 3 kids and are happy.

You mean flying monkeys? It‚Äôs a common term to describe people who are acting for another to control a targeted individual. It‚Äôs really interesting to read about and certainly handy to learn more about it! I believe it was a methaphor from the Wizard of Oz! Flying monkeys often don‚Äôt even realize they are being used, and that‚Äôs how I have people still stalk me. Once I learned about it, the next I learned was Grey Rocking which gave me the tools to live in peace.

I have the opposite problem. I either don't want condiments or only want exactly one packet and yet I'm given 30 of them. I have to lie and say that I don't want any, and ask for a single sauce packet after I've been handed my food. And I have to leave my hands inside of my car so I can't have multiple sauce packets dropped into my hand.  If I'm honest and say that I want just one of them I won't be given just one of them.
I don't doubt that America makes it far easier to get guns than many other countries with high gun ownership rates. But the point is that it's not the guns alone, it's the culture. If the culture says "Guns are a responsibility, and only the responsible should have them", enacts strict controls to ensure that only the responsible do obtain them, and then trusts that the responsible people will put in steps to keep their guns safe from irresponsible people, then no-one who shouldn't have a gun should get them.  There's nothing in British law that says I can't have a gun if I want one. [There are some restrictions on gun ownership, which are explained here](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/13/what-are-rules-firearms-licences-uk) but I could pass most if not all the requirements and get a fun. But here's the thing, I don't want a gun, and if I told anyone I knew that I was applying to get a gun, they would look at me like I had gone mad. The UK's culture doesn't consider gun ownership a constitutionally protected right, it doesn't celebrate me for wanting to own a gun, it doesn't commend me as a proud Brit should I choose to obtain a gun, and it isn't seen as something I should do because it's cool, a part of my heritage, a sign that I can now protect the people and things I care about, or any kind of point of pride.   The UK culture is that most people don't need a gun, and most people go through their entire lives never so much as seeing a gun. There's no interest from many in obtaining guns, and guns aren't celebrated. You're not a patriot for owning a gun, you're not a hero for having a firearm, you're not cool because you have a weapon, and those that do own guns are expected to be responsible for it's safe use, and are liable for any use of it, legal or otherwise.   Easy access to guns is a problem, but it's also the culture. American culture celebrates guns, and this makes people want guns, even when they have no real use for them. Combine this with failed mental health care that's out of reach for so many due to costs, and a media cycle that promotes "us and them" mentality, and stokes the fires of division, and of course people eventually snap, assuming themselves to be the hero of an action movie where everyone else is brainwashed and can't see the big lie that they believe is true.

The ability to follow instructions is a very understated but extremely helpful trait to have.  From my experience with computers, if you can read and understand instructions, you have a huge leg up.  For some reason people look at instructions, their eyes glaze over and they seemingly have no idea what to do.

When I was about nine years old I had my first bowl of chili. I was eating it by dipping potato chips into it. This was in the 90s. The chips we had were (for about three days) all the rage. Yup, you guessed it, they were the 'Olestra' chips (for the uninformed, at the time, olestra was a miracle fat that would taste great and not add fat to your body. The biggest problem was, after eating foods that used it in production, say, potato chips, it caused "anal leakage"). Imagine my surprise when I woke up and ran vomiting down my best friend's hallway after waking up to a puddle of greasy liquid poo on the mattress. It was bad.  Now, nothing against chips, I can still eat chips. I've always been an athletic build and I never overdo the junk food. But oddly, to this day, I cannot eat chili. The idea makes me want to vomit like I did down that hallway.
I think the short answer is just work towards being your best self.  Do you deserve to look like the best 'you' in your mind? Yea you do! Have a good hygiene routine. Washing of course, but also manage your hair and moisturize. Dress in the way you want to see yourself in your head. Even if you only see yourself wearing graphic tees and jeans just make sure they fit right.  Will your best self be able to just ask her out when you see her? Probably. So build that confidence and start just talking to people irl. Say "good morning" and "have a good day" to cashiers at the supermarket. Instead of saying "good" when a waiter asks how your meal is going, say "The chicken is dry as hell. I don't know why I go to Swiss Chalet‚Ñ¢". Eventually practice asking people out. You will get a lot of 'No's but try different things so you'll know what will make her say 'Yes' when the time comes.  Do you deserve to be honest with yourself? Hell yea. So go on dates and cringe. Cringe like your life depended on it cuz you will be making moves that you'll remember years after it happens. Then go "why the hell did I do that?? Omfg that was so bad". Then wallow in it. Bask in it. So much that you think that you don't deserve love and the world should just end the cringefest that is 'you'. Then realize that that's not who you are. You deserve better. You deserve to be happy and not beat yourself down over trivial things like that. Laugh about it with friends. Just own who you are and she will see what she loves in you too.  Hope this helps. The chicken is still dry.

Overall bad hygiene. Doesn't necessarily need to be personal hygiene (showering, brushing the teeths, combing hair etc) as we all have a bad day or moment in time, but what I can't stand the most are the funky smelling garments, dirty socks, stained underwear, sweat stained shirts etc. Come one, you just took a shower, change your clothes also, it is not for the worst.

I was 13 and was broke poor at the time and I tried to get onto this bus to school without paying the fare, but the bus driver kicked me out. A woman just standing at the bus stop, saw me enter and immediately leave and asked what was wrong, I explained to her how I couldn‚Äôt really afford the bus and she said ‚ÄúOh, well a friend is coming to pick me up, we could possibly give you a ride if you want.‚Äù   I just said ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù, and so waited with this woman for 15 minutes until a car pulls up then I remember ‚ÄúWhat am I doing? Why I am going to enter this‚Äôs random strangers car? She seems nice but I shouldn‚Äôt enter a random person‚Äôs car‚Äù and suddenly the whole atmosphere of this lady turns different for some reason, and so I said to her ‚ÄúYou know, never mind I‚Äôll just try the bus again.‚Äù  She was kind of persistent like ‚ÄúAre you sure? Like really sure?‚Äù and after confirming yes after 3 times she got in the car and left. Afterwards I was able to convince the next bus driver to let me on, but I always wondered what would had happened if I entered that car? Would she and her friend really dropped me off at school?
You don‚Äôt tell her. I did this with my ex-wife and she brought it up for years even after splitting. Said it traumatized her and made her permanently self conscious. Was never my intent but oh well at this point. I would suggest a more subtle approach and maybe incorporate some hygiene products or something. Or if she‚Äôs just a girlfriend dump her and find one that doesn‚Äôt stink.

Unsolicited advice: find your strength. Are you better in written communication or face to face? Use that.    Story: there was a guy, autistic, in a group I used to hang out with. He almost never spoke, not particularly polite, no eye contact with me etc. his friend told me he likes me, after some time. I could never tell. I tried to talk to him after, and he would answer with yes or no. Suddenly turn his back to me and go, unusual behavior. BUT he wrote to me to ask something. So we started to speak online. He was a bit weird, but lovely. It also helped to know he didn‚Äôt have the usual social skills, so I kept an open mind. I truly liked him and I would‚Äôve dated him in a heartbeat.
By teachers and faculty. Everything is designed for kids straight out of school and they don‚Äôt want to deviate away from that as it‚Äôs extra work for them.  A few of us adult learners tried to deviate from the course material (with permission) to try and produce work that would actually help us develop as adults and we all got poor grades for it, despite hitting all the requirements as outlined in the scoring material.   It only became more abundantly obvious going forwards how we‚Äôd annoyed the tutor and he just gave us trash marks for the rest of the year, despite us obviously working harder and producing work far in advance of the rest of the class. nothing we could do about it.  ‚ÄòThe nail that sticks out gets hammered‚Äô  That was my second attempt at adult education, my first attempt had me ejected from the college for pointing out that a lecturer was spreading racist ideology.

I don't have a girlfriend any more, I have a wife. I've had many girlfriends (I was a good looking lad) and it's easy enough to keep them if you're both willing to put each other first but at least treat each other as equals. I've never met a woman that didn't appreciate being equal in the relationship, everyone loves becoming someone else's first consideration.  Myself and my wife have 4 kids now so the dynamic has changed but we ensure we spend a whole day together once a week, just so we remember what we love about each other. It works well for us.  I met my wife in a club, she plied me with jugs of cocktails, she tried to match me drink for drink, I was about 16 stone at the time (still in the army so I looked chiseled), she was about 7 stone. I'm 6ft 1.5, she is 5ft 4-5 so there was no chance she would out drink me but I respected the effort.  It's weird what makes me respect people, it's never the same thing between different people but I had a very odd life up until I met my now wife.   My advice: don't look for a girlfriend; that way lies the worst relationships I've ever had. Let it happen naturally, don't force it. Don't close your mind to anyone; be open and you'll notice qualities in others that you might not have realised you were attracted to. Most importantly; treat this woman how you would want your favourite sister to be treated by her partner.   I wish you luck.

He was a great teacher,.. and at that point I decided to stop as well.
They would find it easier to evade molesters and other such predators.  Things would be easier on them for that reason, I believe.

Ah, nice to see someone who actually understand Swiss gun laws! Are you Swiss?  If you see it like that, I agree. I'm Czech, our system is a bit different because you do need a licence but then you can buy basically anything. And the licence isn't that hard to get, even for self-defense, and that automatically allows concealed carry.  We can also get suppressors, laser sights, and hollow points easily.  The problem in the US is that even such systems would be full of holes and wouldn't solve much until the tackle the real issues.

That‚Äôs because when we say a guy is hot, it‚Äôs not followed up by someone violently raping and strangling someone in the bushes. I really am starting to get upset with this butthurt over a double standard that is being horribly oversimplified.   It‚Äôs never been a problem to offer a genuine compliment on either side. The problem is that men have been saying and doing horribly inappropriate things for so long that we are 1- automatically defensive and sensitive 2- royally pissed off about it 3- frikking tired and 4- no longer able to accept compliments in a healthy manner. Because those compliments were not actually compliments. They were consistent harassment and abuse.   And now men realize it‚Äôs not ok and that‚Äôs great. And they are improving and that is also great.   But they still have no freaking clue about what they are entitled to comment on or have an opinion about because they assume they are entitled to everything.    How entitled do you have to be that your biggest problem is that you can‚Äôt just say whatever you want to whoever you want without consequence ? You are going to die if you don‚Äôt tell that lady on the bus she has sexy lips ? You know what I hear when a man compliments my lips ? That boy in the 7th grade that mashed me against the wall and ground his pelvis into mine while he whispered in my ear ‚Äúthose are the best cocksucking lips I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù.    So if your feelings are hurt that you can‚Äôt compliment my lips, why don‚Äôt you go and find THAT guy because he‚Äôs the one that wrecked it for all of you.

I live in Tasmania and we have Tasmanian Devils in our area, which apparently eat everything. So I'd leave it out for them. I'd try to find an animal in your area that would do the same, otherwise chain something heavy to it and dump it in deep water. If that's a no go, burn and bury.

I personally prefer a glass of water, which I always offer too but most people tend to opt for a tea or coffee in my experience.   I don't drink a huge amount of tea or coffee but I do enjoy both, it's more of a once or twice a week thing for me most of the time. I will say though that if you're doing heavy lifting I can imagine a caffeine boost would be helpful when you factor in a long day of driving to boot.

I started to focus less on getting a girlfriend and more on bettering my life situation.  And bam, turns out girls are interested in guys who  - have a life they like - make enough money (I don‚Äôt make a crazy amount but I can pay the bills and get a toy or 2) - have time to do fun stuff  Of course at a certain point you have to put yourself out there and start going to places where you can meet people that aren‚Äôt family or roommates, but without a solid foundation, you won‚Äôt be able to keep people interested in you.  This is a multi-year process and not easy but it is doable.  Best of luck!

The question is not whether they can or not. The question is why would they?? Earth is already populated. But there is nothing wrong in keeping hope. Immortality is impossible right now.

That's not really true, lol. You listen to too many pick up artists if you think that.  And pick up artists are terminally single.  Being fit and healthy is just one aspect you need to improve on yourself with, but it is an important one. Obviously you can't just grind the gym and expect to magically get a girlfriend. Personality is still important. I promise you there are shorter and uglier guys than you without money that have happy relationships because they're fun, interesting, and can take care of themselves.

Raw onions. Especially the red ones. If I bite into a red onion, I can't taste anything else I'm eating and it seems like a day before I can get the taste out of my mouth no matter how much I brush my teeth, etc. I assume it's a kind of genetic sensitivity.

Knowing just how upset your dog becomes when you leave the house for any reason. When i am not working, i take her everywhere i can so she isn't unhappy. Luckily for her and i both, she is a Morkie, thus she is a tiny dog. Most places don't care if she is with me... but i also don't take her places she really shouldn't be at.

This is probably the best take. I'm not willing to call him a sociopath (not affirming that he isn't, it's just a really high bar) but I know he's on the autism spectrum and has a lot of trouble with empathy.      I love that he's willing to take on the figurative and literal moonshot. It's guys like him that drive the species forward but his ethics leave something to be desired.

In Germany, there are "civilian" versions of millitary rifles that only lack the full auto option. Semi still availible. And you are obligated to only use them with 5 shot magazines. But it is super easy to buy and apply a conversion kit. I know people that have the conversion kit "somewhere in the house".

Waiting tables at restaurants across the street from each other. Hostess at my joint (Fancy ass Italian) said that a girl across the street (German Pub) had asked about me. So I wandered over after lunch shift and asked if she wanted to grab a bite and off we went that Wednesday afternoon. Went to dinner Friday and hung out that night. She invited me to her place for pizza Sunday and I stayed over, forever.  We know have a ton of kids and grandkids and are looking at retiring.

Ask your friends to make a reunion with several single people, have them play a complicated game and break the ice by seating next to one of them to teach her the rules, keep talking casually and telling her about yourself so that she becomes interested while also asking her about hers (with follow up questions) to show your interest and ask her out.
Yes, and let's not forget the cart is near one side of the aisle, they are on the other side, and their outstretched arm traverses the middle. Nobody, but nobody shall pass.   (this is when I walk up, take a deep breath and stand there telling myself this is an opportunity to slow down and relax. Just when I start to feel that way, they look up and say, Oh, I'm sorry, in just such a fashion as to make you feel like *you're* the one who was kind of the a-hole)

That's cool!  To have that amount of patience for something you love. What do you do know if you don't mind me asking.   Native cultures know exactly what does what. For example, saint John's wart has been used for centuries for it's properties.  i doubt they would the chemical components, more that it's   magic. All that trial and error must have been horrific lol. I really wish there was a more  mainstream focus the medicinal properties in plants as treatment for ailments. Some of the potential drug interactions of wild plants are deadly. Like using Coprinopsis atramentaria has potential has as means to stop drinking alcohol.  The Coprine in the mushroom stops the metabolism if alcohol which will make you sick.

Girls are attracted to money, power, looks, charisma, things,... Just get yourself some of those and they will line up.
My friend (not so close) broke up with his girlfriend cuz one of his close friend asked her (the girlfriend) to be his girlfriend because they were taking a break through Instagram and at that time her phone was with her friends and they thought it would be fun to say yes to the message which my friend (the boyfriend) found it except that he didn‚Äôt know that the one who said yes was his girlfriend‚Äôs friend and not his girlfriend and got really mad that he started calling her a sl** and a wh*** a lot and she(the girlfriend) tried to convince him and say that it was not her fault but he didn‚Äôt even listen and she (the girlfriend) got really sad and drunk all her dads alcohol (finished approximately 3 bottles fully) and was so drunk that she saw a perfume bottle and thought it was alcohol and drank it and then FaceTimed another friend of mine (not the ones mentioned above) and while she was talking with him she coughed blood and my friend immediately called her elder sister and informed her and they took her to the hospital and the entire school knew about this. She is alive

Fifth grade: during summer break, a girl died of an aneurism while on a trip with her family.  Sixth grade: a girl was killed when a train hit her babysitter‚Äôs car. I can still hear the screeching of the car being dragged down the tracks.  10th grade: a boy died in a solo motorcycle accident.  11th grade: a boy committed suicide.

I guess so, yes. In this Moment i just thought "if i decide to do it, he cant force me" which is pretty stupid.
That apparently it's important to talk about race and it's only by talking about it we get closer together.  But if you're a straight white man and you offer an opinion on the matter, you're shut down immediately and they say "well easy for you to say as a Straight White Man!" And then demonise you afterwards. Like it's now a crime to be a straight white man it feels like sometimes which is really sad considering we're all meant to be closer together.  So much for being in this together.  Another one being, women flirting with a man and saying absolutely anything is okay, but if a man does it to a woman he's a creep, sexist, misogynist and a danger to woman.

Dana Carvey's *Master of Disguise* was... not... a great movie. But if there's an equivalent term for 'cult classic' for a single - But entire - household, it was certainly that. We watched it several times, we counted to each other regularly.  As teenagers we even hosted a watch party for this stupid movie, a costume party that everybody was 'too cool'/lame and insecure to dress up for. "I came disguised as myself."  Except for two: one disguised herself as a strawberry. But the other.... he used rope to tie himself to a mattress, pillow, blankets etc and came disguised as a mobile bed.  So anyway this is not a good movie. But it is a good memory.

A trick of some sort. Something important is always left behind/put out of mind.  I think with what's broken, wonder,feeling,passion, they cease to be good honorable things and become poison. It's a reaction with you, it's not in them innately. So it's not hatred for them, but they'll not get a fucking pedestal.  I won't put my faith in passion,belief,wonder,etc.. It's what allows the trick to work.  My thoughts are piss off patchy ass promises. It's just not a patch sorta job.

It depends on the country. Some countries are quite liberal with their caviar classification and I think that has caused some issues with EU legislation. The tubed stuff we call caviar in Sweden is probably the most controversial example.
Met her at a party and we are still in the honeymoon phase almost 10 years on. Funnily enough I'd said to myself for the first time about a month before to forget about searching for love for now and focus on living my youth. Weird how fate works.

My mum was convinced into selling Avon for ages. Gave it up in the end because she got a job at the post office, thank god. It took up so much of her time. Avon absolutely flooded the UK military bases for 10-15 years. One of the main reasons was that one of their body sprays worked as mosquito repellent so people stocked up for their holidays. It all goes downhill from there, though, and suddenly you have way too much, overpriced nail varnish because you have an order limit and your friends only want the fucking mosquito spray.

>So now it's up to people to protect themselves haha, you people can't even be consistent.   In public gatherings where the R rate of the virus is greater than 2, like airborne viruses? Then it's up to the government and the pandemic response team. Since the government can't go to everyone's rooms when they have sex, they can't really mandate condoms to protect against STDs. You're lucky either way, because they'd never need to go to your house.  >You'll probably deny it but Reddit hates the idea of even consenting unmasked parties, events etc because it's "irresponsible" and I'd bet anything you obviously hold the same opinion.   Yeah, they're called superspreader events, dipshit.

I've been on the other end of that.  A while back I started work at a company and REALLY hit it off with the boss in the interview (we ended up chatting for 2 hours and he sent the other applicants home). I have a proper education, but it was tangentially related to the job I was hired for. We'd discussed training me up and then letting me run. I made it clear I would need the training before starting independent work.  Day 1 I'm given a project that a long-time employee had devoted all his spare time to. I have no fucking clue what I was doing, as I'd received literally zero training. I was expected to complete the project AND do my regular work AND do on-call emergency work (salaried, no time given off and no extra pay if I had to work for 4 hours between shifts). I did NOT complete that project to their (or my) satisfaction and completely ruined other dude's reputation (he couldn't help as he was saddled with new work) because everybody knew it was his pet project.  I quit after 6 months. From what I heard, stories were told of me until the business went under a few years later. I guess I still tell stories too, TBF...

Anything with onions (no matter the amount, if something has onions i just don't eat it, especially if they are cut to small size so it's extremely difficult to pick them out),  Vinegar (and all things that have it - sauces (like ketchup, barbecue sauce), pickled cucumbers or generally anything pickled),  Tomatoes,  any vegetable that has been boiled,  any combination of fruit and bread (for example apple pie or raisins in buns, I cant think of a single meal where fruit and bread fit together),  fat (around meat for example, i usually use a sharp knife and cut the good parts out, a strip of bacon takes 3-4 minutes but better than the alternative..),  mushrooms,  cauliflower and similar vegetables (like broccoli) (no matter how it's prepared but steamed is extra yucky),  alcohol or traces of alcohol,  beans (every kind),  peas (I think it's a type of bean but not sure, raw are not that bad but when prepared they are disgusting)  drinks that have these bubbles (like coke, tastes and feels so much better if you leave it for a few days),  all seafood except smoked red salmon and salmon caviar (oysters, shrimp and other sea products),  any combination of sour fruits and sugar (like caramelised apples),  yogurt that has fruit pieces in it (if its completely smooth then its alright),  things in soup (i usually just pour all soup through a sieve and drink it), crusty food like toast (painful to eat)  any type of meat besides pork, chicken and beef  steak that has red in it (like rare, medium, just if there is red or pink, pretty much just well-made steak and maybe cooked for a bit longer so it's 100% brown.)  kombucha (my mother loves it for reasons I will never understand)  I am absolutely sure I missed a huge amount of things but these are what first comes to mind. :D  And I eat things according to my schedule, so I try new food very rarely, so I haven't tried a lot of different foods throughout my life, If I had I am sure the list would be much bigger.

Bruh fr. But worse was this entire family of 3 adults not controlling their little kid who was in the very first row who kept talking loudly and literally jumping and standing on their chair. I felt so sorry for the people in the rows behind. Plus it didn‚Äôt help we where in a premium theatre for Spider-Man that had less than 30 seats. So when someone is being disruptive they entire theatre is disturbed.  And when it‚Äôs a movie like Spider-Man your been waiting years to see? I‚Äôve never wanted to boot another persons kid so badly. Was even more disappointing when I saw how many adults where in that one family that didn‚Äôt bother to control their lid

Shows how rigged the game is.  &#x200B;  Used to be a 1 in 15 million chance of winning... then they doubled the price of a ticket and added 10 extra numbers... and surprised pikachu face when people stopped playing.

this is a weird one.   I was 17  ( I looked way younger though) at the time of this, I‚Äôm now 22. But I remember it very clearly because it freaked me out.  I was at a petrol station finishing up buying what I needed and was heading home, and for some reason I saw this grey Ford ute drive past on left side of the road (Aussie roads so I honestly don‚Äôt know how he even saw me) this car just caught my attention, then I saw it three times after that drive up and down the main road‚Ä¶ as I was walking home, which wasn‚Äôt far, but as I walked down the street that lead me home, this car came flying up a side street and nearly hit me as I was crossing the road so he was watching me but I had a feeling I was going to see it again, They stopped let me pass and then pulled up got out of their car and asked me if I needed a ride home‚Ä¶. TIL this day I think if I had gotten in that car I wouldn‚Äôt have been seen again‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know why this car caught my attention‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm glad my gut told me to keep an eye out, and to say no‚Ä¶   ( he was an older guy, and well he seemed desperate to get to me so honestly that gave me the creeps so much because why dude?! This was in the day time aswell and idk maybe he was just trying to be nice, it was hot but I was five minutes away from home‚Ä¶ not that I told him that but yeah)   anyways I got on the phone to a friend for the rest of the walk and had a mental note of his number plate just in case he followed me or something. I did tell my parents aswell but never saw the car again after that‚Ä¶   I have watched a lot of murder docs and I feel like if someone is that desperate to get you in their car somethings off‚Ä¶

I was sleeping, dreaming some boring regular dream about work and all of a sudden my grandma showed up and pulled me aside to tell me she loved me and a few other things and then walked out the door. As soon as the door shut I woke up in a cold sweat with a feeling that something had happened, it was 5AM in the morning, I woke up my then boyfriend because I was so on edge, he calmed me down and talked me out of calling or going to check on her because it wasn't an appropriate time of day to call someone or show up on their doorstep over a dream. Turns out she had a brain aneurysm and passed around the time I had that dream, and I will never forget that feeling.

I didn't know you were supposed to shoot an arrow to the sun after clearing the water temple for fire arrows. So I went the whole game not knowing fire arrows were a thing and ended up using sticks or shooting arrows through fire. Most of the time it worked fine, except when you get to Ganon's castle. There's an area where the deku stick fizzles out just before you can use it, and it's angled in such a way you can't do the arrow through fire trick. So I just gave up after a whole afternoon of trying. Internet wasnt what it was today, so I just had to wait till I got to school and asked a friend who came over and instantly saw I didn't have the fire arrows.

Swiss gun laws are primarily about the acquisition of arms, and not ownership. As such a license is not required to own a gun by itself, but a shall-issue permit is required to purchase most types of firearms. Bolt-action rifles do not require an acquisition permit, and can be acquired with just a background check.A reason is not required to be issued an acquisition permit for semi-automatics unless the reason is¬†other than¬†sport-shooting, hunting, or collecting.Permits for¬†concealed carrying in public¬†are issued sparingly.The acquisition of fully automatic weapons, suppressors and target lasers requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office.¬†Over-the-counter sale of hollow-point and soft-point ammunition is limited to hunting.  So basic gun control. Licence and permits for acquiring do functionally the same in my mind. Point beeing is that you need to regulate who gets a firearm.

I smoked pot every day for 13 years with no intention of ever stopping, and then I noticed it wasn‚Äôt helping me relax for a couple nights in a row. So I took a break and then when I smoked again a couple weeks later in a social setting, I was fumbling all my thoughts and words and didn‚Äôt enjoy that either. Haven‚Äôt smoked since (that was June). I don‚Äôt miss it, i can‚Äôt say my life has improved, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to struggle with quitting, maybe instead of me giving up on marijuana, it gave up on me?

Milk tastes different in every country in Europe. It has a lot of difference even if you travel only 200kms, because the culture and the rules change, and that's for every product, not only the milk. I don't understand why we need to pay, I find it very frustrating. The thing is that if you don't have change than you have the chance that they'll not take a bigger bill because they can't give back change.

Didn't happen *at* my school, but;  Elementary school music teacher ran into a church in the middle of a service and shot the organist in the chest, then left. He came back in and then shot her in the head to ensure she was dead, then the attendants took him down.  Later discovered the organist was his ex-wife and she had information that he could not allow her to expose.  That information? You guessed it: CP. Police found ~~**two terabytes**~~ (see edit) of it on his computer. I really don't know what would've been worse for him, being known as a murderer or a pedophile, but now he's known as both.  Edit: Holy shit, I was wrong, they found a box full of hard drives and photographs all containing CP.

I would throw away my paper plate or just do whatever, clean off the table and sitting there, in the top of the trash bin would be that red, empty bag of instant mash and I have no idea why that messed with my head so bad as a kid but it just really got to me. Like my mom.. could lie????? WOAHHH!!!  Even now, if i'm told it's real potatoes by anyone who's been kind enough to make me dinner (family on thanksgiving, christmas, just an everyday meal, ect), even my gf, I always check the garbage quickly for that stupid red instant mash bag.  And let's say I go over to someone's house and they make mashed potatoes and I check the trash for a instant mash bag.. Even if there is no bag in the trash that I can see, I have this delusion in my head that my entire family knows I hate mashed potatoes and just buried the bag far in the can so I wouldn't see it so that I will eat it at christmas, new years, whatever and then I get paranoid and don't eat them anyway.  I know I should've been grateful for having even a meal when I was young and a mom to prepare it but goddamn potatoes arent even that expensive. A lb can make you a lot of shit and its only 5ish$ (around 2-4$ back when I was young based on the potato you bought) which was a lot less than what she was spending a week on instant mash.  Anyway real mash, fake mash, its all shit and i'll never understand why people like it.

>He's an egotistical, narcissistic cunt with a god complex who thinks he's some kind of messiah... He's not... he's a greedy, selfish, self absorbed cunt.  Ngl most leaders I read about are. I'm not a fan boy I'm just pointing out that it seems to be a common trait among people who lead.   >All he's ever done is take other peoples money and ideas and market them as his own... He didn't start tesla, he took it over.  But he did save it from bankruptcy while future was uncertain. It seems very probable that he went all in for the advancement for electric cars not just money. Which he has a shit loads of anyways. Started space X and neuralink if I'm not wrong.   >He's never actually had an original idea of his own... he comes from wealth and his family acquired that wealth through apartheid in South Africa.  But isn't his fortune mainly the pay out from paypal though? I didn't know that his family was rich though.   I did hear criticism about him being indifferent about where the rare metals are being mined from for the batteries. That seems to be very disturbing

However, she stopped believing it was me when it finally clicked that I never actually left the house enough to be going on all these ‚Äúadventures‚Äù and parties. now she wishes it was me.

all I would say is: before BOTW and buying a switch I was 100% in the same boat.  Now, after playing through BOTW [twice], skyward sword and the Links Awakening remaster - those alone have been worth it.

I have a similar incident to share. There's an actor in my local state and he's loved by thousands here for what a gentleman and a great versatile actor he is. He was not even 30 years old when he died. And how he died just broke my heart. He was peacefully having dinner at his house when one of his friends came and hurried him out to meet another friend. As it was late night and roads were all empty, none of these guys wore a helmet. Lost control of the bike and collided head on into an electric pole and fucking died the next day in hospital. It's one of the deaths that breaks me every time I think about it.

Romantic relationships. Not worth it, too painful, too long to recover, always fails. Look at it like this; I'm nearly 38, I met my sons mother at 25, was with her 5.5yrs, we broke up, it took 1.5yrs to recover. Got in another relationship for 4yrs, we broke up 2 years ago. That's 13yrs (a 3rd of  my life) including recovery wasted on failed relationships. I'm not wasting another minute. Lone wolf for me.
I think you‚Äôre wrong. Again, you aren‚Äôt ever **owed** someone‚Äôs forgiveness [and he really doesn‚Äôt need me to like him. The way society is set up, he really suffered no consequences for fantasizing about racist murder in the first place]. His learning and growth, if genuine, shouldn‚Äôt really be contingent on what others think about him, but a desire to become a better person for his own sake. And as Abraham Kendi noted in response, ‚ÄúThe defense of Liam Neeson that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äòact‚Äô on it is like exonerating a drunk driver who doesn‚Äôt kill anyone.‚Äù Not how it works - at least for me.

Me, my brother & my buddies were sitting outside one summer until like 4am talking about conspiracy and stuff like that. Well my brother brought up something like "the government or extraterrestrial could be listening/communicating through radio/phone frequencies." Then all of a sudden he got a phone call from Idaho and when he answered it, it was a bunch of beeping, buzzing, static and woowoo (idk how to explain it) sounds. Well we freaked out and ran inside cause we are all pussies. We wanted to track the number to see wtf was up but when we got the call log pulled up, the number wasn't there. No problem, he could've deleted it. Fast forward to a couple of nights later, we were camping, sitting around the fire telling stories and someone brings up that phone call at like 3am this time. Immediately after bringing it up, the same number calls my brother and we answer it to show some people who weren't there the first time. It was the same sounds and stuff. So my brother hangs up and this time immediately goes to the call log, only to find the number has vanished from it yet again. I told my friend this later on in the year, and guess what pops up on her phone? A call from Idaho. Now we never speak of it because some weird shit be happening when we do.

Yeah, same place - except that I wouldn't say I'm clean, I'm on subutex, slowly but steadily dropping the dose. I've not used for several years. I've got clean before, sometimes for a year or two - and then relapsed when life got hard. I won't be repeating the cycle again though. Quite aside from the fact that I've got no fucking veins left - I have finally reached a point in life where I want to continue living. Like you, I've overdosed a few times and been lucky. I imagine you also know people who didn't make it.  I just can't do it anymore. I won't go back to that perpetual desperation. In a weird way, I needed it for a while but that time is gone. I have a job and a life now and want to keep them.  I know it's possible to get overconfident - but I just feel such regret and revulsion when I look back at bits of my past that I really don't think I'll repeat it. It's scary to know that I've got it in me to fuck up that badly, but now I know I'm capable of it and I'm on guard against my darker inclinations.   Like you say, fuck that shit.

I was on the Gulf Coast when hurricane Katrina hit. The day after the storm we were walking through what was left of my town and I saw an over turned car. When I looked inside there were 2 bodies in it. I guess they decided to ride out the storm at home and then tried to escape when it started getting bad. Their car must have been flipped by either the wind or the storm surge and they couldn‚Äôt get out. Their bodies were stained black from the mud. I was only 8 when I saw them but I‚Äôll never forget it.

Eureka. And for that matter, Warehouse 13 (Which are nominally different shows but play in the same universe)     Basically, Eureka is a secret city in the US that is full of the newest, most advanced tech, because the average IQ in the town is above 135. The main character is Sheriff Carter however, who is one of the few people with an average IQ in the town, and his job mostly revolves around stopping scientists from destroying the entire city (and sometimes the entire world) with their various tech, be that on purpose or by accident. However, his average IQ proves as an advantage a lot of the time, as he doesn't think like the scientists around him, and thus sometimes sees details that other miss.     Warehouse 13 on the other hand is basically the SCP Foundation. Their job revolves around collecting a bunch of artifacts from all over the world and locking them in the titular Warehouse 13 to stop others from misusing them, which is easier said than done, as the artifacts all have severe side effects, so you might have a trench coat that turns you invincible when worn, but also turns you into a serial killer, a butchers knife that will cure any injury, but transfer it to the next person who touches it, or a trident capable of causing cataclysmic earthquakes when stabbed into the ground. Some have accused the shows writers of stealing the idea from the SCP Foundation, but seeing how it was basically unknown at the time the idea would have been pitched, this is unlikely.

Meghan is closer to being universally hated than liked. At least in the US she is. We liked the idea of her back in 2018. We liked that one of us (an American) was going to be apart of the royal family but then she turned out to be a narcissistic hypocrite who treats her staff like dirt.  So disappointing.

Online petitions are ineffective get out onto the streets in your millions and protest then you will also find out what it means to live in a so called free and democratic society. Good luck to you and keep a fire in your belly. Go stick it to the man!

Never explicitly been to an Asian country before (unless we count Turkey), but there's a native Japanese woman in my city who owns a ramen bar, so I have to say Ramen. They adjusted their recipes for us Europeans a bit, like making bigger portions and offering to add some of the fat from preparing pork belly to make it more savory, but I'm pretty sure at heart their bowls are still very authentic.  You can look up all the dishes on the menu, you'll find exact copies of them on google images.

I'm a little late with this, but I still wanna share my incident.  It was September of 2020, we had been losing power that evening and so we decided to go to bed. I stayed up late, just looking at memes on my phone because that's what I do. I got up to go take my allergy meds and realized that our dining room was no longer dark. I looked out the front window and saw that a hill across the river from us was on fire. In fact there was a lot of fire pretty much all around us. I woke everyone up, and we packed as fast as we could, grabbed anything valuable, and drove out of town. That night most of my home town burned, as well as most of the surrounding area.  We found out later that our house burned shortly after we got out. Basically, we very well could have died in that house fire if I hadn't been up looking at memes on my phone.

Honestly,  It‚Äôs like she joined the royal family with the express purpose of trying to ruin/change it. As if there isn‚Äôt an implicit agreement that you are JOINING the family, not them ACCOMMODATING you.  Megan Markle is a nobody and this is fucking British royalty.

Date a crazy person. I dated a girl during late high school. She was insane. Some of the highlights of our time dating.  * Waiting outside her house, in fairly cold weather, for her parents to go to sleep so I could sneak in and spend the night. * When at a small social gathering of friends she crawled in to cuddle with another friend for the night. * Double date at a friends house for movie night, wouldn't leave my penis alone, for the entire 2 hour movie. * Offer to flash my friends to get something. * Had a crush on another friend so pursued him (eventually married him)  Never again. There were other things, but man it was a wild and thankfully long gone ride.

That's so interesting, thank you. I was kind of thinking that but didn't want to say cuz wasn't totally sure. It makes sense. You mentions it disregulated your dopamine system - doesn't MDMA predominantly impact your serotonin? Does it fuck with your dopamine too? I was always told that MDMA strictly impacts serotonin, and I know cocaine works more with your dopamine.

Alcohol Abuse. I currently work in construction & served 9 years in the military. If I had to put a number on it, I'd say somewhere north of 40% of people that are in these groups abuse alcohol to destructive levels.
U do. I was just joking. I like Justin too. Mainly his newer stuff
They eat rotted shark in Iceland. It‚Äôs called hakarl and Gordon Ramsay once declared it to be the most disgusting thing he‚Äôs ever put in his mouth.  I imagine that this dish was invented when some poor fisher folk found a dead shark on the beach, and buried it in the sand to keep it from stinking up their village.  Four months later, while they were going through one of Iceland‚Äôs many famines, they remembered the dead shark they buried.  It was dug up and provided enough nourishment to keep them alive.  It is traditionally consumed with like a shit ton of alcohol, because why else would they eat four-month-old shark carcass?    Most of Finland‚Äôs national cuisine seems to have been invented for similar reasons, namely, ‚Äùwe live in a frozen swamp and we‚Äôll die if we don‚Äôt eat this tree bark and rock hard bread and moldy turnips, and wash it all down with like a shit ton of potato vodka.‚Äù
It's interesting to think about what a huge difference the last 30 years made.

Everyone starts out as a happy drunk. I‚Äôve been drinking since I was 14 and I just now at the age of 32 am a sad, depressed, quick tempered, and apathetic drunk.   Some people click that in a few times when they drink. Some later. Or maybe we were never happy to begin with??

I met an adult sibling who had never met our shared father. It was wild, we got super drunk and talked all night. They shared so many mannerisms and other quirky similarities to our dad that it was mind blowing at times.   We keep in touch here and there, send each other love, but don‚Äôt live anywhere near each other so never really got super tight or anything. Instant love there though, for sure! They met our Dad shortly after and they‚Äôve been talking semi regularly on the phone but I think it‚Äôs still a fairly surface relationship.

We had a kid on my school whos parents were JW. Furthermore he always smelled strange, like his clothes had not been allowed to dry properly. He was a nice enough kid, but the weight of the bullying...  Anyway, i recall one day, this must have been in 5th or 6th grade, someone was talking shit to his face again, and i just noticed him clenching this pocket knife. So I grabbed the teacher, without the guy noticing, and they managed to get it from him. I recall him crying afterwards.  The worst was: i knew exactly how he felt. Being bullied everyday is soul crushing. Never being given any credit for anything, always being mocked and ridiculed for anything. Hoping to be ignored because that's better than the alternative. Having any feelings displayed disregarded, etc.   This kid had found a way to empowerment. To do something, to make them see him or at the very least fear him, instead of him fearing them. And this was taken away from them, the one chance he felt at rising from the pit he lived in shattered by those who were supposed to have prevented him falling into it in the first place.  I'm not saying he should have stabbed  anyone. I am still happy he was stopped, it wouldn't have helped anyone. I hope he is in a better place now. But my point is that the level of frustration that brought him to this... Thinking about it still hurts, and i doubt most people truly understand what brings kids to this, and if they truly cared, it would be solved.
Ramon Tikaram is of Indian (South Asian) descent, not Native American. That would be funny if true though.

Categorically the worst thing I've ever done. The free fall bit wasn't too bad tbh as I thought I might soon get the sweet release of death, but the second that parachute opened (which by the way means the harness nearly castrates you) and the guy controlling the stupid thing started spinning us round (to get down faster) I hated every second of it.  By the time we touched ground I just had to lay on the floor for a bit. I then felt sick, for a full 48 hours.  This was 2 years ago. My wife still laughs about it now....

When I was maybe 11 or 12, on Christmas Eve, I remember being in the front passenger seat of my mom's Toyota Corolla as she drove to my aunt's house, terribly upset because my step father was spending Christmas Eve with friends instead of us.  (It had been going down hill for a long time already, and they were staying together for the kids kind of thing.)  I remember the street as it curved to the left, and she was upset as she drove quickly down the street.  She then said, "I should just kill the both of us right now, so that you'll never leave me."  Then, she swerved to the right as if to crash the car.  To this day, I genuinely believe she tried to commit suicide with me.  Since then, I never got into the car with her without large amounts of pillows.  Once I could start driving, I never let her drive me around again.

The most horrific crash I ever saw in person and not something I wish anyone to experience ever again.   You hear people say ‚ÄúI watch racing for the crashes‚Äù have never experienced the pure terror of watching that man crash and feel like you just watched him die in front of you.   The worst we through was happening to Fox did happen to Alex Zanardi a few years later.

i try to talk things through, be as honest as i can (very strong feelings can hinder this, i think mine are stronger than what most people have) and avoid lying. i want to understand a person i cannot understand, but i cannot attempt that forever if that person doesn't let me. i want to honor my promises and my relationship by being faithful. i do not wish bad for regular people even if their behaviour has traumatized me, made me hate myself and want to end myself. i just want them to know what they've done, and understand and acknowledge it so they can be a better person next time.

I don't really think it has to do with believing or not believing in it... I mean it is a very legit thing. Tons of people did think Mandela was dead, tons of people did argue over how Berenstain Bears is spelled including myself (the thought was that it was stein not stain). Like, what's the debate about it not being real? People do serendipitous agree on things that never actually happened all the time.

I cooked with fresh bird's eye chilis once. I'd cooked with frozen ones before and had been fine, thought nothing of it as I chopped them up and put them in my dish. I didn't wear gloves.  I SHOULD HAVE WORN GLOVES.  I'd put them in my dinner. Around midnight, my fingertips started to feel a bit tingly. By 1am, they had a decent burn going.  I managed to fall asleep, but they were still burning the next morning. I had to keep putting ice packs and towels soaked in cold water on my hands all friggin day. I tried every remedy on the Internet. Dawn dish soap. Rubbing alcohol. Nothing worked.  The burning didn't stop till late that night, so about 24 hours of constant burning. I was useless that whole period of time.  It's a lesson I'm not inclined to forget.
Run a 5K  I was SO psyched to do this when I first started getting in shape.  I'm gonna be an athlete!  I'm gonna love this, then next it'll be a 10K then a half-marathon and then YEAH BABY THE LA MARATHON!  So I, a plump middle-aged woman, trained diligently at the Y, with advice from all the different trainers, and picked a race that seemed pretty flat (LA, Chinatown), and on a day that would be cool (7am on a day in February).  Day of the race: I take off --there were about 2000 runners, apparently it's a popular race--they do a 5K and a 10K.  Literally everyone passes me almost immediately.  And it's hot.  80 degrees.  In February.  WHY?    And then--it gets worse--the course took a sharp left turn and started going up, up, up, up, up towards Dodger Stadium.  Anyone who hadn't already passed me, continued to pass me.  The ladies who were just trotting along and chatting passed me.  I sweated and panted and hoarsely tried to catch my breath as I slowed almost to a walk.  I hadn't even passed the first mile marker yet.   I started to mutter "Never again.... never again.....I know we Jews use this saying to demark the Holocaust, but from now on it shall demark Me Running another 5K race...."    Then I finally got to the top of the hill, where they had the SECOND mile marker.  I'd somehow missed the first marker, and also they had a lot of WATER to drink.  And the rest of the course was downhill!   I bravely continued, thinking "I'll speed it up a bit," only to discover I literally could not move any faster than the very slow trot I was mustering up.  More people sped past me.  I figured I was literally going to come in dead last.  But here came the third mile marker, only a bit more to go... I can do this.... I literally staggered across the finish line.    The funny part was I didn't come in last, I actually came in about 40th in my age group, and would have been even higher ranked in my ACTUAL age group!  And made my best time, as mortifyingly high as it was.    But all I can say is.... NEVER AGAIN.    On the plus side, I took up weight training and love it.
[NSFW]When i was in high school, I use to always catch the big yellow school bus home.  (Some Context) It's not a normal thing because I'm from The Bahamas where everyone mostly uses public busses or carpools with friends. Headed home one day my friends and I were in the very back of the bus. We had to ride through a small community where there was an elementary school and normally small kids (ages 7 and above) walking home or through the community after school.  Apparently, it was known in the community that the smaller kids would would run to cross the street right before cars were close to make them slow down or stop and run through  shortcuts or bush roads laughing.  Kid runs in front of our school bus and gets hit (about 30 kids are in the bus) and we literally felt his b**y get hit. The driver swerved to avoid hitting anyone else which caused the kid to go underneath the bus and for some reason he flipped and hit the side of be r0ll3d over by the right side of rear tires. (Same side I was on) I felt everything. Saw his lifeless body, brains and everything on the road. so yeah I've seen alot growing up in the Carribbean and this was one of the worst. RIP to the kid

Yeah I remember during the somewhat recent tensions, there were like bombings where  many children and innocent Syrian civilians were killed. To me the first thing to say is "we must focus on ending the violence, children and innocent civilians are being killed", not just siding with who you generally side with (everybody will understand this anyway).   And I know what's happened to innocent Israelis before, and Jewish people in general all over the world too - I hate antisemitism with a passion, but I also hate Islamophobia and anti-Middle Eastern peoples sentiment in general towards any category with a passion too. The whole situation is very nuanced but that's irrelevant sometimes, because sometimes you should admit when bad shit is bad shit.

25 years old, committed relations always.   Let me tell you, it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm ‚Äútired‚Äù of seeing my gf‚Äôs body, I‚Äôm just use to it. You know that feeling when you FIRST see someone naked and you‚Äôre excited and like ‚Äúoh boy!‚Äù? Yeah that fades away the same way people don‚Äôt watch the same porn video a million times.   Although, that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt find my gf attractive. My gf is by far the hottest and most beautiful woman I have ever been with And she‚Äôs a real treat to be with.   When she bends over: of course I‚Äôll love to see that and spank her   I still have sex with her very often.   Idk how else to explain. But when we‚Äôre not hot and horny and she‚Äôs walking around naked (fresh out the shower) it‚Äôs not like I stare at her like ‚Äúoh boy! Time to fuck!‚Äù   So define boring? Cause I‚Äôm deff not ‚Äúbored‚Äù but I wouldn‚Äôt check her out too much passed a glance if we‚Äôre doing normal house things. But if she was in the mood and being sexy?

The show follows two competing groups of scientists who try to build a bomb in the 1930's, base off the real life Manhattan Project.

The amount of money required to help people isn‚Äôt the newly wealthy person‚Äôs design. it‚Äôs just the circumstances they can now afford to overcome. That they choose to is admirable, but the $ amount is meaningless to me, & so it‚Äôs not something I can respect.

> because the nobles hated him for making reforms and she returned to more status quo.  Well there is that, but it's mostly because of the fact that Russia was on the cusp of total victory against Prussia in the Seven Years' War, but then Empress Elizabeth died and Peter III (a Prussophile and admirer of Frederick the Great) succeeded her, who then proceeded to unilaterally withdraw and return all Prussian lands conquered by Russia to Frederick the Great and allied Russia with Prussia. This was called the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.  Naturally everyone who fought in the Seven Years' War and all the nobles and the Russian people became angry and resentful of Peter III for what he did, and this is what sparked the coup of Catherine the Great and the overthrowing of Peter III.

Some apes also bury their dead. It's interesting to see how much we have in common with animals. I'm not saying that compassion is unique, it's very well documented that animals show compassion to one another and are capable on some level of empathic thought. But I do think that our attempts to care for and provide for people in society who can no longer do so, while still striving to treat them as equal rather than burdensome is uniquely human. To me that's a step even above compassion that as far as I know we haven't seen exhibited by many animals aside from us.

I am borrowing this idea from a Silver Surfer from Marvel Comics What if storyline.  Id give ever single human on earth Cosmic Awareness.  For a brief moment everyone would know everything   The suffering of the poor, war-weary, starving, afflicted by disease, and also the feeling of wealthy and no worries and no problems.  When all of humanity learns what others are doing to others and how much suffering there is maybe people would set aside their differences and help each other.
It was a Christmas gift from a very supportive grandpa, but a cursory google search of my model (which is far more than sufficient for personal use and I can personally confirm does indeed show sperm) tells me that you can get one from [their site](https://omaxmicroscope.com/awarded-2018-best-compound-microscope-omax-40x-2000x-lab-led-binocular-microscope-with-double-layer-mechanical-stage-w-blank-slides-covers-and-lens-cleaning-paper.html) for $244, and with free shipping apparently. This model is awesome and comes with all the accessories you would need like slides, cover slips, immersion oil, lens papers, etc. and has a really nice bulb. I don't think it's the exact same one I have because mine also came with a digital USB camera attachment so you can hook it up to your PC and view on there, but I think you could probably buy that separately anyways. They do have far cheaper models as well, but I can't speak to how well they perform or if you'd get enough magnification to see what you're hoping to.   &#x200B;  I cannot recommend it enough, though I'm probably biased haha.

My sister‚Äôs best friend lives near a pretty cool trail that takes you up to this rock ridge where you can see the sunset over the city, so we hiked up there, cooked over our fire and debated on staying the night. Eventually we decided to just head home, but it was pitch black outside, so we were fumbling through the woods with one flashlight. I heard something crunching leaves and twigs, but it was walking as quietly as possible. With our one flashlight, we landed on a pair of eyes that crouched low to the ground as a reaction to our light. These eyes were high up, close together like a cat, and huge glowing white. We kept our cool and made it back to the house, but who knows if they followed us. All I can think about is if we were still up on that ridge and they were walking towards the smell of our fire, which was up on a steep cliff where we would‚Äôve been cornered. I presume it was mountain lions but they‚Äôre not recognized as a native animal in my state. Whatever they were, made me stop hiking at night though :(

WHY? what can you do right now to achieve these goals? answer these questions and read the answers everyday

The less I know the better
sounds like a lot of yall here need therapy
Timeless. I know the fans fought for it and loved it, but I personally don‚Äôt know many people who watched it. It‚Äôs on Hulu now, I think, and definitely worth the watch.
Yeah, this was a definite sleeper hit. Went in blind, was pleasantly surprised
born in 2001 and these comments are really screwing with me. This sounds like how life was supposed to be lived. Every single one of these comments that has been replaced by mobile phones feels like it is the more human way of that task being done. They don't even sound like *that* much more of a hassle, just slightly more inconvenient. I'd trade that extra sliver of convivence any day to go back to this way of life. I know you want what you can't have but this ridiculous dependency I have on my phone for absolutely every single little thing makes it feel like I'm being cheated out of truly experiencing a human life, and I don't think anything a mobile phone could do would surmount that.  Off topic I know but it just seemed that every single comment continued to solidify these thoughts in my head.
I really loved Messiah on Netflix. It had a really cool is he Jesus or not plot going on the entire time and a good cliffhanger at enof the season.  Naturally it got cancelled before season 2 but I'd really love to see where it was going.
Incorrect. People should be criticized and condemned for their opinions, it helps them understand if it is something they actually believe in or if it is something that isn‚Äôt worth believing in. However, I don‚Äôt believe in imprisoning people because of their opinion alone.
Idkkkk, if you ever been to prison, you meet people with long sentences and literally no support on the outside. From my experience you get some deodorant that didn‚Äôt do shit, soap (which was usually so small it lasted a day or two) and toothpaste, a couple shirts, pants, socks, and these flat uncomfortable shoes (Bruce Lees they call it lmao) when you arrive, but other than that you have to acquire everything else through commissary including more soap, tooth paste, cloths, shoes ect. Idk how it works everywhere but where I was at most jobs payed 75 cent a day which meant you made 5.25 a week if you were able to work all 7 days. Tooth paste, bar soap (not counting shampoo and conditioner) and deodorant on commissary would definitely cost more than that. But if you have no support on the outside, it‚Äôs not like you really have a choice. And the worse part is you can receive a weekly care package of the same soap, deodorant and toothpaste from when u came in, from the prison as long as your indigent and the only way to qualify as indigent is to have less than 5$ in commissary for at least 3 months. So for guys that had no support on the outside they did seem like slaves. Since they pretty much have no choice but to work these jobs to make a little bit of money to be able to by basic shit to take care of themselves. But at the same time these workers had way less than every other prisoner who has someone supporting them on the outside.
Why do people worship Jesus Christ? or Buddha? They were good men but those people really worship them?

Never, as gas cars will be retrofitted with ev batteries‚Ä¶  Depends on the govt and country mandates?  A very long time as the third world is still using bicycles.
That's horrifying.  I'm very sorry it happened to both of you.
An R-rated war movie set in the Star Wars universe could potentially be good.
You ever hear a boston girl have an orgasm?
Git gud
Slow, gradual process for me. I always felt that if anything I'd be bi since I do like women (as a man myself), but in time I realized that it was probably just that I do prefer women, but wouldn't mind if it's the right guy either.  Not sure about pan since I know nobody who is NB personally, doubt that it would matter though.
go back to sleep
yes! I rented a private theater to see the new spider-man with my bf and his friends and there's 2 that still have not paid me back their share and it's getting awkward asking
Ah yes I also loved the ent scene in lord of the rings
Redish colors. Red, orange, wine red, cherry pink.  I don't think it's the colors but because it's the last day of my vacation and I loath my job.

Yes, Farty Owls, was a masterpiece, as well.
I would be fine living there at all, as long as it's underground. Having seen parts of Kansas around Olathe, it's absolutely beautiful country.
Give birth.   No thanks.
That show was the very definition of "start as you mean to go on".  From the very first episode:  > Veronica: We need a mouse that can stand temperatures of 195 degrees. > Ted: [to audience] We can do that.   > Ted: [to Veronica] Uh, computer mouse or live mouse?   > Veronica: I'll get back to you.   > Ted: [narrating] Every  day, there's something new waiting to be discovered.   > Veronica: [entering office] Computer mouse.   > Ted: Easier.

I find them very attractive on Asian men, specifically Korean and Japanese where it is very frowned upon. Apparently it's to do with potential gang connotations.  It's not a big deal where I live in Australia, heaps io people have them, but it's still hot AF.

What's another?
It isn't worth living. I'm only around because some people would be hurt if I'm gone.   I have never wanted to be alive, and still do not enjoy it.
Drunk driving.
